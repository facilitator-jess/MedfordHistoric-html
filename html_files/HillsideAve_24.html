<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>While the form and location of the Hervey Carriage House - Patterson House suggest that it was originally an outbuilding of some kind, historic maps and other records show that it has been classified as a single-family dwelling almost from the time of its construction prior to 1897. The Patterson House is a one-and-a-half story, single-pile, side-gabled building. Centered on the building are two gabled wall dormers bridged by a shed wall dormer. Below, centered on the facade, is a single-story polygonal bay with a flat roof. The main entrance is immediately to the left of the bay, and is sheltered by a single-story open porch with a flat roof. The porch extends to the south elevation gable end, and is supported by paired Tuscan-order columns. A second single-story polygonal bay with a flat roof is centered on the first floor of the south, left-side elevation. While the building’s foundation is not visible, its walls are covered in aluminum siding and it has an asphalt shingle roof. The modern replacement windows have false muntins, giving them the appearance of six-over-one sash.</em></p>
<p><em>The Hervey Carriage House - Patterson House sits behind 26 Hillside Avenue (MDF.284) and is accessed by a long driveway leading back from Hillside Avenue. The lot is small, and does not abut any public way. A privacy fence divides the two properties, making it difficult to see parts of the Patterson House. Aerial photographs show that much of the front yard is taken up by an in-ground swimming pool.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The subject property is located within the original boundaries of the estate of Thatcher Magoun (1775-1856), the well-documented ship builder and Boston shipping merchant, as in the 1855 atlas.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>By 1875 Hillside Avenue had been constructed to serve a subdivision located on the south slope of Pasture Hill that remained in the ownership of Thatcher Magoun, Jr. (1808-1883), a business partner of his father, and his sister, Mrs. Martha Bradshaw Magoun Adams (1812-1885). The subdivision was slow to develop, however. No buildings had been constructed on Hillside Avenue as late as 1889, by which time the former Magoun land west of the avenue had been sold to Frank Hervey (1838 – Feb. 10, 1918).</em></p>
<p><em>Frank Hervey was a prominent local merchant and proprietor of the Boston Branch Grocery at 11 Main Street between 1890 until at least 1916. He was also a veteran of the Civil War.</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>The store was located directly behind Old City Hall at the south west corner of Main and High streets. He later brought in his nephew Edgar J., who took over management and changed the name to Edgar J. Hervey Co.; Edgar resided nearby at 27 Grand View Avenue with his son, Chester A. Hervey, an employee of the market. As early as 1890 Frank Hervey resided at 4 Hillside Avenue, today 26 Hillside Avenue (MDF.381). By 1898 Hervey had constructed three other houses on his property: numbers 16 (MDF.378), 20 (MDF.379) and this house. Although the Hervey - Patterson House is sited, designed and massed in a manner that would identify it as an outbuilding, probably a carriage house and stable, it was depicted as early as 1897 (Sanborn) as a dwelling. Since that time it has always had residents and appeared in directories and census records as number 24. The reason for the change from an outbuilding to a residential dwelling is unclear, but only one other house in the neighborhood has a large, significant outbuilding. Another possibility is that the building was designed to house both vehicles, draft animals and a chauffeur and other household staff, a not-uncommon arrangement in this class of property.</em></p>
<p><em>Edward Archibald Patterson purchased the house from Waldo S. Plastridge in 1920. At the time Plastridge was also the owner of 26 Hillside Avenue (MDF.381), the house directly in front of the Patterson House. This suggests that it was not until 1920 that the two buildings were under separate ownership, although as noted above, the Patterson House had residents living in it since it was built. Before purchasing the house, Patterson and his wife, Alice C. Pooley Patterson, were living with her family on Tufts Street, where they were listed in the 1920 census. At the time, they were both bookkeepers for a hardware store. Later directories list Patterson as a manager of a business at 8 Salem Street in Medford. Alice Patterson died on April 6, 1938. The directory from that year lists Patterson as the manager of the Sinclair Hardware Co. at 8-10 Salem Street. The 1940 census listed Patterson living with his son, sister-in-law, and a lodger. He was also listed as the proprietor of a hardware store, suggesting he had purchased Sinclair Hardware by that time. Patterson owned the house on Hillside Avenue until 1959, when he sold it to the current owners.</em></p>
<p><em>The Patterson House is part of the Hillside Avenue Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 21, 1975 and which was made a local historic district on February 15, 1985.</em></p>
<p><em>John W. Russell, probable architect</em></p>
<p><em>A 1970s area form of the Hillside Avenue Historic District identifies John W. Russell as the architect of both 16 and 20 Hillside Avenue, both similar architecturally and both constructed for Frank Hervey, suggesting Russell designed all four of the buildings commissioned by Hervey at the time. Directories from the time show that Russell lived in Medford and had an office on Tremont Street in Boston. John W. Russell (b. c. 1852) resided in a boarding house at 68 Ashland Street between 1890 and 1930. He maintained offices in Boston at 5 Pemberton Square during the 1890s and 110 Tremont Street between 1920 and 1930. Although little is known regarding Russell’s training, his partner between 1905 and 1927, Henry Preston Clark (1853-1927) was educated at M.I.T. and the Academy des Beaux Arts in Paris, the pinnacle of architectural training worldwide during the late-19<sup>th</sup> century, suggesting Russell’s qualifications were of a similar caliber. The firm received commissions for a number of high-profile buildings and residences in the region, including the Public Library of Hyde Park at 35 Harvard Avenue, Boston (BOS.10957), 15 Channing Place, Cambridge (1899), the W.C. English House (1912), the Teresa A. Crowley House (1909, 86 Dean Road, BKL.1533) and the Hermann F. Clarke House (1916, 420 Warren Street, BKL.1276), the last three in Brookline.</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
