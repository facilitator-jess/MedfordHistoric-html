<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Nicholas White House is one of several Queen Anne and Shingle Style houses perched on a hill overlooking Medford and Boston. The house is, at its core, a two-and-a-half story end house with a rear cross gable expanding its north elevation and a two-story gabled ell at the rear; the ell is one room wide and flush with the north elevation of the main house. A two-story polygonal bay with a flat roof covers the south (right) bay of the main façade. To the north, wrapping around the northwest corner of the house, is a single-story enclosed porch with a hipped roof. Another single-story enclosed porch, this one with a flat roof, extends from the rear of the house, along the south elevation of the ell. On the roof are three dormers: two on the south face are gabled, and a third on the north face is shed.</em></p>
<p><em>Sited on a very small lot on a hill, the building’s foundation is exposed on the south and east sides. The house sits on a cut stone foundation, likely the work of the original owner, a stonemason. The house is mostly covered in wood clapboards, with wood shingles used to create visual interest in several locations: patterned shingles highlights the gable ends, while a band of square shingles runs between the first and second floors of the polygonal bay. The rear enclosed porch is also covered in square shingles. The house has few other architectural details. Its simple cornice is supported by a large fascia that is interrupted by a row of small dentils, which are continued in the gable ends. While for the most part the house has replacement windows, two-over-one sash can be seen in a few places, such as in the basement at the rear and on the shed dormer. Cloth awnings have been added over two three-part picture windows on the first floor of the south elevation.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>Although the Nicholas White Tenant House appears as a cohesive part of its neighborhood, it was actually built separately from many of the neighboring houses. Built between 1889 and 1898, the Nicholas White Tenant House was one of three houses on a parcel of land on the east side of Grandview Avenue owned by Nicholas White. The land to the west, including the west side of Grandview Avenue and all of Hillside Avenue, was a separate subdivision laid out about the same time White had his three houses built.</em></p>
<p><em>An Irish immigrant who came to Medford in 1850, White became a prominent stonemason, laying the foundations of a number of prominent buildings around the city.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Grace Episcopal church, the foundation for the Opera house building and Odd Fellows’ hall, the public library, the First Baptist church, of Malden, and the old St. Mary’s church, of Malden, were built under his supervision. He also constructed the water and sewer systems of the towns of Hull and Nantucket, and many buildings for Engineer Bowditch, of Boston. He was employed in the laying out of the large estates and land in the wealthy residential section of the town of Lenox. For several years he was road commissioner when Medford was a town.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>White was also active in various community organizations, particularly Irish groups like the Ancient Order of the Hibernians. While attending events marking George Washington’s birthday in 1907, White took a short fall down a set of stairs, and died several days later.</em></p>
<p><em>While White built (presumably for himself) an impressive stone house at the top of the hill, two less ornate Queen Anne style houses were built to the south of his residence. As White was always listed as the owner on maps, the early residential history of the building is unclear. By 1920, the Lamprey and Hall families had moved in to 27 Grandview Avenue. That year, Percy A. Hall, a produce merchant, was listed at the address with his wife Pauline A. and their two children, along with his father-in-law, Morris J. Lamprey, and his wife, Pauline C. For the previous few years (1916, 1918) the families had been living at 31 Grandview Ave. The same group was listed on the 1930 census, with the addition of a daughter for the Halls. However Pauline C. Lamprey would die later that year, and Morris J. Lamprey a few years later, in 1939, leaving only the Halls and their two daughters at the address in 1940. Lamprey was a carpenter, while his son-in-law Hall was a produce broker.</em></p>
<p><em>The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Hillside Avenue NR Historic District April 21, 1975 and included in the Hillside Local Historic District February 15, 1985.</em></p>
<p><em>John Nolan, builder</em></p>
<p><em>John Nolan is listed as the builder of the Albert W. Ellis house on the 1975 MHC Inventory Area Form. This attribution is not cited, but appears to come from "Medford Building Records." Nolan is also listed as the builder of the house to the north, 31 Grandview Avenue (MDF.393). A John Nolan is listed as a carpenter in the 1897 Medford directory, but it is unclear if this is the same John Nolan that built the two houses. No other information is available about Nolan.</em></p>
