<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The</em> Gianelli-Milona House <em>is a variation of the split-level house built in 1961 that stands out in a neighborhood of elaborate Queen Anne and Colonial Revival style houses from the 1890s. In most split levels, the house is composed of two blocks, a single-story section which includes the entry and the primary public rooms, with a two-story section that is adjacent but offset vertically so that the bedrooms are found half a floor up, and the informal and service space, and sometimes a garage, are found half a story down. This example employs offset stories but resembles a Garrison Colonial with a flanking story-and-a-half wing. The east (right) half of the</em> Gianelli-Milona House <em>is a full two stories, while the west (left) half is a story and a half: a window in the basement on the main façade suggests there is finished living space at that level. The double-pile side-gable house sits on a poured concrete foundation and has an asphalt shingle roof. Most of the house is covered in vinyl clapboard siding, except for the main façade of the two-story eastern section, which is covered in patterned wood shingle. A rear single-story, gabled wing appears to have been added to the building more recently.</em></p>
<p><em>On the first floor of the two-story eastern section is the main entry with a single-bay, single-car garage to the right. The entry is a simple modern door and is framed by full-height sidelights. The second story of this section slightly overhangs the first in a "jetty" evocative of the Colonial Revival style popular at the time of its construction. Two windows are placed directly under the cornice line on the second story; they are one-over-one sash, with muntins giving the appearance of horizontally-split two-over-two sash. There are four similar windows on the east elevation, showing the building’s double-pile depth. The main façade of the western story-and-a-half section of the house is highlighted by a centered oriel window composed of four casement lights sheltered by a ribbed metal awning. An exterior brick chimney is located on the gable end, placed slightly in front of the ridgeline. A black "M" was likely placed on the chimney by the current owners, the Milonas.</em></p>
<p><em>The interior plan of this split-level house, a type which was exceptionally popular nationally during the decades of the 1950s through 1980s, is revealed through its entrance and fenestration. The main entrance of this example is a variation of the general pattern- as the entry is located in the two-story section; it also has the raised basement under the lower section. This suggests the location of a basement ‘rec’ or ‘playroom,’ which might more commonly be found in the ground level of the larger volume. These houses became popular for the efficiency of their plans combined with a preservation of privacy: entertaining spaces, including the living, dining and kitchen areas were located in the lower volume, while bedrooms and bathrooms were separated by another half story stair above secondary spaces, often the garage. The location of the garage in the ground level of the façade under the bedroom wing was an innovation of the type that had a profound influence on subsequent popular house designs.</em></p>
<p><em>Sited on the north side of Grandview Avenue, right after it turns west after running north-south, the</em> Gianelli-Milona House <em>faces south across the street. The house departs from traditional grass lawn landscaping and instead crushed stone covers the small front yard, with landscaping immediately against the house. A short brick retaining wall contains the crushed stone. All of the landscaping has the appearance of being completed recently. A large paved section extends east from in front of the building’s two-story eastern half. A modern vinyl privacy fence extends from the sides of the house around the entire property line, blocking the rear yard from view.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The</em> Gianelli-Milona House <em>is built on land that was once part of the estate of Thatcher Magoun (1775-1856), the well-documented ship builder and Boston shipping merchant, as it appeared in 1855.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Magoun’s house, an elaborate Greek Revival mansion that served as the public library until it was demolished in 1958, was located on the site of the present library building at 111 High Street. By 1875 Hillside Avenue had been constructed to serve a subdivision located on the south slope of Pasture Hill that remained in the ownership of Thatcher Magoun, Jr. (1808-1883), a business partner of his father, who resided on the south side of High Street (see MDF.AQ) and his sister, Mrs. Martha Bradshaw Magoun Adams (1812-1885). The subdivision was slow to develop, however.</em></p>
<p><em>Grandview Avenue was added as an east loop off of Hillside Avenue by the time a plan was filed with the Middlesex Registry of Deeds in 1887, showing a subdivision of Mrs. M. B. Adams’s land. At the time, Grandview Avenue was given the name Patten Street. Most of the lots in the neighborhood were built on during the 1890s, although a few, including lot 5, the lot of the</em> Gianelli-Milona House<em>, were left vacant. Until 1961, the lot of the</em> Gianelli-Milona House <em>was owned by the owners of the lot to the west, 31 Hillside Avenue (MDF.385). That year, James and Adeline Selvitella sold the lot to Dingolo Construction, Inc. A few months after the company purchased the lot, Dingolo Construction sold it to Joseph M. Giannelli, presumably with a new house on the lot. Giannelli, a Medford native, was the football coach at Medford High School from 1962 to 1965. He was a standout athlete at the high school while he was there and is a member of the Medford High School Hall of Fame. After his graduation he served in the Navy during World War II, and upon his return from the Pacific he attended Western Maryland College, graduating in 1950. Before coaching at Medford High, Giannelli coached at Hofstra University and Boston University. After leaving Medford High, Giannelli went on to coach football, lacrosse, and golf at the University of Connecticut for 37 years, winning a number of championships and coaching awards with the golf team. Giannelli died at the age of 76 in 2002.</em></p>
<p><em>Giannelli’s move to UConn in 1965 necessitated him selling his house in Medford, which he did in 1966 to Constantine and Marianne Milona. The Milonas established a trust for their house in 2000, and the trust continues to own the property. Constantine Milona died July 22, 2007.</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Dingolo Construction, builder</em></p>
<p><em>Dingolo Construction was incorporated on December 18, 1953, with an address of 121 Mystic Avenue in Medford. The company was founded a few years before by Anthony Dingolo, and later run by his son, Richard. Dingolo Construction was involuntarily dissolved on May 31, 2007.</em></p>
