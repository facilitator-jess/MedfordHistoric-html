<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The C. H. Webster House is a large two-and-a-half-story cross-gable Queen Anne-style building with complex massing perched on a hill at the intersection of Hillside and Grandview avenues. The house has a main gable-front section with a cross-gable extending to the west in the left-side elevation. In addition to the cross gable, the house has a number of projections and features typical of the Queen Anne Style. The southeast corner of the main façade is accentuated by a polygonal two-story tower with a peaked roof. An open porch on the first story wraps around the main façade to the front-facing cross-gable section on the left, which is where the main entrance to the house is located. This prominent feature, supported by turned posts and decorated by elaborate tracery below the cornice and an elaborate railing composed of cut-out patterns, serves as the locus of much of the house’s decorative effects. A smaller covered balcony is located on the second story of the main façade at the southwest corner. A two-story polygonal bay is located in the rear pile of the cross gable’s left elevation and is capped by its own gabled roof. The width of the rear of the house is covered by a two-story flat-roof ell that provides significant additional living space.</em></p>
<p><em>The house is depicted on the 1903 Sanborn map as having two-and-a-half stories, suggesting the entire building was originally covered by gable roofs, including the rear ell. Currently the rear ell has a flat roof, suggesting this configuration is a later alteration. One possible explanation for such an alteration is damage from a fire, although no record of such an event could be located. Originally built as a single-family house, it has since been converted to a three-family dwelling. It resembles the house type identified by Hubka as a ‘parlor bypass,’ where the porch provides access toward the center of the house, with the parlor in the front section facing Grandview Avenue.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>The house sits on a brick foundation, the first floor is covered in painted wood clapboards, the second floor in painted patterned wood shingles, and it has an asphalt shingle roof.</em></p>
<p><em>The hillside location of the Webster House is made even more dramatic by its location at the intersection of two neighborhood streets, Hillside and Grandview avenues. Although the house has an address on Hillside Avenue, it faces onto Grandview Avenue, likely to take advantage of the views to the south overlooking Medford and Boston. The lot is supported by a stone retaining wall along the sidewalks. A long set of stairs leads from the street up to the main entry porch. The Hillside Avenue frontage of the lot is interrupted by the remains of an in-ground, two-bay garage. What remains are the side and rear masonry walls of the building. The condition of this structure suggests it once had a frame roof that has subsequently disappeared. The small size and steep slope of the lot have left little room for landscaping or mature trees, with some shrubs on the west side of the house, and a very thick line of evergreen separating the lot from the house to the east.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>Although Hillside Avenue was laid out as early as 1875, it was not developed until the closing years of the century. The steep hillside location and sweeping views down into Medford and Boston give the two neighborhood streets their names: Hillside and Grandview avenues (although an early plan shows Grandview as Patten Street). The neighborhood was developed in the 1890s as a cluster of mostly Queen Anne style single-family houses on small lots. During the 19<sup>th</sup> century the land belonged to Thatcher Magoun (17 June 1775 – 16 April 1856), a prominent Medford ship builder and merchant. After his death, his two surviving children, Thatcher Magoun (4 August 1808 – 27 May 1883) and Martha Bradshaw Magoun Adams (17 October 1812 – 13 June 1885), inherited the property, and are marked as the owners on an 1875 map.</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>In 1890, a plan was filed with the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds dividing the land on the east side of Hillside Avenue into nine lots, and laying out Grandview Avenue, what was then called Patten Street. Martha Bradshaw Magoun Adams inherited the land after her brother’s death, as the plan covers land belonging to "Mrs. M. B. Adams."</em></p>
<p><em>The first resident of the house was Charles Henry Webster (1858 – Apr. 16, 1900). He is listed in the 1893 Medford directory as a music teacher living at 1 Hillside Avenue, and he is the owner listed on the 1898 atlas. The 1897 directory indicates his mother was living with him in the house. After Webster’s death his widow, Jessie S. Webster, was listed in directories at the address until 1907. She is enumerated in the 1900 census as living with her niece and a boarder; no mention is made of her mother-in-law, suggesting she had died or moved out by 1900.</em></p>
<p><em>The 1910 census lists Rolla A. Horton, his wife Elizabeth, and their daughter Leona. Horton was a superintendent with the Medford Union.</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <em>He is also listed in the 1912 directory at the address, but no other information is available on the Hortons. The house does not appear to have been enumerated in the 1920 census. Two households were listed at the address in the city’s 1924 directory: that of Edward A. Nash, a policeman, and Edward M. Ports, a machinist. It is unclear if the two were related.</em></p>
<p><em>By 1928, Margaret McArdle had moved in with her daughter Alice and Alice’s husband Herbert Block, a clerk. Mrs. McArdle was the widow of John McArdle, and the family had lived in Medford since at least 1910, when they were listed in the census at 27 Marshall St. The McArdles were Irish immigrants, but their children were born in Massachusetts. Directories list two of Mrs. McArdle’s other children living at the Webster House in 1928 and 1930: James P., a mariner, and Margaret Carnes, no occupation given. Mrs. McArdle died before 1940, when her daughters and their families were listed in the census one house up the street, at 21 Hillside Avenue (MDF.277).</em></p>
<p><em>The house is listed as vacant in the 1938 directory, but by 1940 had taken on a large number of residents, including a number of female lodgers. The head of the house was listed as John J. Harrington, a district cashier for an unnamed newspaper. He was living with his wife, Anita E., and their son, John J. Listed as boarders were: Edward and Ethel Cotter (a WPA clerk); Louise McDonald and her daughter Ethel, a payroll clerk; Hazel Lane, an attendant nurse in a hospital; Edna Perry, a maid in a private house; Alice McGrath, a waitress; and Herbert M. Hughes, a coffee salesman. This is similar to other nearby houses, which list a larger number of residents, particularly lodgers and boarders, in the 1940 census. Today the Webster House is listed in assessor’s records as a three-family dwelling, and it was likely converted to multi-family living around 1940.</em></p>
