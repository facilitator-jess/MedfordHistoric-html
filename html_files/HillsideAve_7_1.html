<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Fred M. Lamson House is a commodious two-and-a-half story, double-pile, hipped-roof Colonial Revival style house built, like its neighbors, in the last decade of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The house is three bays wide with a center entry that is sheltered by an original single-story, shed-roofed enclosed porch. A wide pediment that covers the middle-third of the porch highlights the location of the main entrance. The large square volume of the building is expanded by polygonal bays on the left side of the façade and a two-story bay on the rear pile of the south elevation. The house is extended to the east by a large two-story flat-roofed rear ell. Maps show that this ell was added between 1903 and 1910. An at-grade secondary side entrance is located on the north elevation, with a polygonal bay window above it between stories, indicating a hallway or stairs between the two rooms on that side. There are three dormers on the house: a single gabled dormer centered on both the north and south side-facing roof slopes, and a larger hipped roof dormer with three windows on the east, rear face of the roof. Other features include a Palladian window and wall gable centered on the second floor of the main façade. The windows on the house are modern replacement one-over-one sash, with modern casement windows used in a few places. The house has a visible cut stone foundation, is covered in painted wood clapboards, and has an asphalt shingle roof.</em></p>
<p><em>At the rear of the Lamson House, fronting onto Grandview Avenue, is a small, flat roofed, one-car garage constructed of concrete block with a brick façade. The main façade is given a bit of architectural embellishment through a stepped parapet wall over the opening. This outbuilding is not depicted on the 1936 Sanborn Atlas, indicating it is a more recent addition.</em></p>
<p><em>The Lamson House is sited near the entrance to the Hillside neighborhood on the east side of the street, and faces west over the Medford Public Library. The building’s corner location at the intersection of Hillside and Grandview avenues means that Grandview Avenue forms the northern border of the Lamson House’s property. The lot is minimal, with the house flush against the sidewalk on the north side. The front yard is very steep, and is covered in large evergreens and shrubs, partially obscuring the house.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>Although much of the land in this area belonged to Thatcher Magoun and later his heirs prior to 1875, between 1875 and 1889 a lot was set out for Wesley Parker Dutton at the east corner of High Street and Hillside Avenue. Sometime before Dutton’s death in 1898, the lot was spilt into two, with Dutton’s house remaining on the lot fronting on High Street and a new lot created to the north on Hillside Avenue. The earlier High Street-facing Dutton House does not survive, currently serving as a surface parking lot for the adjacent CVS story at 81 High Street. By 1897 Fred M. and Grace Lamson were living in a house on the new lot; it is unclear whether they were related to Dutton. Lamson was a clerk in Boston, and later the manager of a trust company.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Fred Lamson continued to live in the house after his wife’s death in 1907 and was listed in the 1910 census with just a housekeeper living with him. He remarried in 1913 to Helen Lucille Foley. By 1920 the Lamsons had moved. That year Harold H. Lyons and his family were listed in the census at the address. Lyons was the sales manager at a candy factory. The Lyons family does not appear in directory listings from around 1920, suggesting they did not live in the house very long. By 1924 the house was occupied by Gurden E. Fuller, his wife Mercy J., and his widowed mother, Hannah C.; Fuller’s father had died in 1922. Fuller was a tailor. The Fullers moved within the neighborhood; as recently as 1920 census, they were listed at 20 Hillside Ave. The Fuller family moved out prior to 1938, after which Edward L. Blake and his family were listed in directories at the address.</em></p>
<p><em>The 1940 census suggests that the Blakes were using the house as a nursing home. Listed in the census that year were Edward L. Blake, a packer for a film company, his wife Alice M., a nurse in a private home, their son John J., listed in directories as a projectionist at the Orpheum Theater in Malden, and Alice’s elderly father John H. Pattee. In addition to the Blakes, however, there were five lodgers between the ages of 68 and 87. This, combined with Alice’s occupation as a nurse, suggests they were operating a nursing home or a hospice. There were also three other lodgers in addition to the elderly ones: Anthony G. and Esther L. Machado (a car mechanic and a children’s nurse, respectively) and Anne Craig, no occupation given.</em></p>
<p><em>The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Hillside Avenue NR Historic District April 21, 1975 and included in the Hillside Local Historic District February 15, 1985.</em></p>
<p><em>Edmund W. Kingsbury, Kingsbury and Richardson, Architects</em></p>
<p><em>Edmund Winchester Kingsbury (12 September 1862 – 1931) is listed as the architect on the 1975 inventory form for the Hillside Avenue Historic District. Born in Boston, Kingsbury graduated from the Architectural Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston in May, 1883.</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>He formed a partnership with Walter Pearce Richardson, a fellow M.I.T. graduate, in 1889. The firm maintained offices at 43 West Street in Boston. A period source notes: "They make a specialty of designs for fine dwelling houses…and the services of the firm are in constant request throughout New England."</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <em>A second attribution of Kingsbury and Richardson in the Hillside LHD is 31 Hillside Avenue (MDF.385). The firm also designed several houses in Brookline; one for Charles B. Appleton in Brookline, as well as the Nickerson-Alexander House (BKL.703) and the Davis-Macomber House (BKL.704).</em><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <em>In Cambridge the firm designed buildings at 6 Buckingham Place, 270 Mt. Auburn Street and 16 Traill Street.</em><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <em>Kingsbury was also considered an accomplished watercolorist. A review of an exhibition of 50 works held at the gallery of Charles E. Cobb in 1898 reported:</em> "among them some very excellent bits of landscape, and some fine effects in sea scenes, painted from Mount Desert, Jamaica, Florida, Italy and also from Framingham where Kingsbury lives. His ‘Old Spanish Steps Jamaica’ was especially admired."<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <em>He married Helen Ovington of Brooklyn, New York on May 15, 1894. The couple lived in Framingham and had two children, Theodore Ovington Kingsbury and Elizabeth Winchester Kingsbury.</em></p>
