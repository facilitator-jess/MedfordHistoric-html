<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Raymond D. Mudd House is a small, simple Ranch house typical of its 1960 construction date. The house is a single-story, side-gable, double-pile house with a center entry. The house sits on a poured concrete foundation, is covered in vinyl clapboard siding, and has an asphalt shingle roof. The centered main entry is accessed by a high set of stairs leading to a gabled entry porch, all of which appears to be a recent update. The assessor’s photograph shows an older view of the building, and shows the house with a wrought iron railing on the stairs and the entry covered by a metal hood typical of the 1960s and 1970s. On either side of the entry is a three-part window composed of a large picture window framed by narrow one-over-one sash; both three-part windows have shutters. The other windows visible on the house are one-over-one sash. While the Mudd House’s driveway runs along the north (right) side of the property, there is no visible entrance there. Instead a secondary entrance is located on the rear pile of the south (left) elevation. Like the main entry, it is covered by a gabled entry porch, and a concrete walkway matching the walkway to the main entry leads around to the secondary entrance.</em></p>
<p><em>The Raymond D. Mudd House sits on the west side of Grandview Avenue, facing east across the street. Because of the steep slope of the lot, the house is raised above ground level. The lot is open, with no trees blocking the house. The house does not have a garage, but does have a small side-gable utility shed at the end of the driveway.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Ryamond D. Mudd House is built on land that was once part of the estate of Thatcher Magoun (1775-1856), the well-documented ship builder and Boston shipping merchant, as it appeared in 1855.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Magoun’s house, an elaborate Greek Revival mansion that served as the public library until it was demolished in 1958, was located on the site of the present library building at 111 High Street. By 1875 Hillside Avenue had been constructed to serve a subdivision located on the south slope of Pasture Hill that remained in the ownership of Thatcher Magoun, Jr. (1808-1883), a business partner of his father’s, who resided on the south side of High Street (see MDF.___) and his sister, Mrs. Martha Bradshaw Magoun Adams (1812-1885). The subdivision was slow to develop, however.</em></p>
<p><em>Grandview Avenue was added as an east loop off of Hillside Avenue by the time a plan was filed with the Middlesex Registry of Deeds in 1887, showing a subdivision of Mrs. M. B. Adams’s land. At the time, Grandview Avenue was given the name Patten Street. Most of the lots in the neighborhood were built on during the 1890s, although a few, including the lot of the Mudd House, were left vacant. Until 1960 the lot of the Mudd House, shown as Lot 7 on the Adams plan, was owned with Lot 6, to the north, where 36 Grandview Avenue (MDF.392) was built. In 1960, Gordon S. and Emily M. Ellis, owners of both lots, sold the unimproved portion to Dorken Realty Corporation. The company was registered in February of 1956 with an address of 1 City Hall Mall, Medford; the corporation was dissolved in 1983.</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>Rather than maintaining the original lines of the lots as shown on the Adams plan, the lot of the Mudd House was made smaller, cut down to 6,443 square feet from 8,305 square feet. The reason for this change is unknown, but likely had to do with the large size of the house at 36 Grandview Avenue. In 1961, Dorken Realty Corporation sold the lot to Raymond D. and Ann Mudd, presumably with a newly-built house.</em></p>
<p><em>Raymond D. Mudd (1919 – Mar. 29, 1980) was a senior health inspector with the city of Medford. His wife Ann died on February 14, 2004. Raymond D. Spencer acquired the property from her estate in 2006, and it has passed through a few owners since then.</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <em>The property was listed as "not researched" in the Hillside Avenue National Register of Historic Places District 4/21/1975 and included in the Hillside Avenue Local Historic District 2/15/1985.</em></p>
