<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Manfred E. Nichols House is the most elaborate example of the Queen Anne style within the Hillside Area. The large single-family house is similar but somewhat more complex than others built in the neighborhood during the 1890s. The two-and-a-half story hip-roofed building, five bays wide and two piles deep, has a number of projecting elements that give it dramatically picturesque massing. One of the building’s main features is a round three-story tower at the southwest (left-front) corner. This is balanced on the southeast (right) corner by a more integral two-story, cornice-height tower that is square on the first story and polygonal on the second story. Between the two towers on the main façade is the central main entry, covered by an open porch with a shed roof supported by Tuscan-order columns that wraps around to cover the base of the southeast tower. Above the main entry is a projecting gabled wall dormer that shelters a small second-story balcony accessed by a door. Stick detailing and a patterned bargeboard accentuate the gabled dormer. The balcony detailing is more ornate than the main porch, with turned posts and curved stick detailing under the cornice. Equally elaborate additional massing extends from the rear pile of each side elevation in the form of a cornice-height projecting bay terminating in a projecting gable; on the more-elaborate, fachwerk-decorated east-facing (right) elevation a rectangular bay overhangs a polygonal bay at the second level; the west-facing (left) bay is entirely polygonal below the third-level projecting gable. The right bay is enhanced by its elaborately cased and configured fenestration that includes casement and stained-glass windows. A full-height, gabled rear wing projects from the main body of the house, and a smaller shed-roofed component fills in the re-entrant angle at the right-rear corner of the building.</em></p>
<p><em>Sitting on a stone foundation with an asphalt shingle roof, the house is covered in painted wood clapboards, with a band of patterned shingles between the first and second floors as well as in several of the gable ends that forms a skirt. Between the varied textures created by the house’s siding materials are elaborately molded band courses at the second-floor and cornice levels. The windows on the house are one-over-one wood sash that appear to be original: the tower windows retain their curved sash and lights.</em></p>
<p><em>Sited on a corner where Grandview Avenue turns north after running east, the recently restored Nichols House is on a double lot, giving it more space than other neighborhood buildings. This is likely why it is one of the few buildings in the neighborhood with a carriage house or other large outbuilding. The front lawn of the Nichols House is very steep and covered in evergreens. The area to the east of the house is a paved driveway space.</em></p>
<p><em>Carriage House</em></p>
<p><em>The Nichols House retains a carriage house that has been consistently depicted on maps since the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, suggesting it was part of the original build. The square single-story hip-roofed carriage house is sited to the east of the main house, close to Grandview Avenue. The entry is placed at an angle on the southeast corner, and projects slightly beyond the building. The entry projection is capped by an elaborate bell-cast, double-sloped pyramidal roof, setting it off from the building. A set of recessed double doors leads into the building, while a secondary single-door entrance is located on the east elevation, in a small projection that the main roof extends down to cover. Like the main house, the carriage house has a stone foundation, is covered in painted wood clapboards, and has an asphalt shingle roof.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Manfred E. Nichols House was built on land that was part of the larger Thatcher Magoun estate, the well-documented ship builder and Boston shipping merchant, as it appeared in 1855.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Magoun’s house, an elaborate Greek Revival mansion that served as the public library until it was demolished in 1958, was located on the site of the present library building at 111 High Street. By 1875 Hillside Avenue had been constructed to serve a subdivision planned for the south slope of Pasture Hill that remained in the ownership of Thatcher Magoun, Jr. (1808-1883), a business partner of his father’s, who resided on the south side of High Street (see MDF.AQ) and his sister, Mrs. Martha Bradshaw Magoun Adams (1812-1885). The subdivision was slow to develop, however. No buildings had been constructed on Hillside Avenue as late as 1889, by which time the former Magoun land west of the avenue had been sold to Frank Hervey (1838 – Feb. 10, 1918).</em></p>
<p><em>The Manfred E. Nichols House was owned by a series of dry goods merchants. Manfred Earl Nichols (1837-1899), based in Charlestown, first appears in directories at the address in 1890.</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>He is listed as living on Grandview Avenue for the rest of the 1890s, but does not appear on the 1900 census at the address, suggesting that he had moved by that time. That year, flour dealer John McPherson is listed at the address in census returns. McPherson lived in the house with his wife Eudora, two sons, a niece, and an Irish servant. By 1908 the O’Callaghan family had moved into the Nichols House. That year John H. O’Callaghan, also in the dry goods business, was listed in Medford directories at the address. In 1910, the census enumerated O’Callaghan, his wife Fannie (sometimes shown as Annie), and their nine children – John H. Jr., Madeline, Mary, Camilla, Frances, Helen, Leonard, William, and Robert. The O’Callaghan family owned the house until 1965, and was enumerated in census records at the address throughout the first half of the century. Several of the family members are shown consistently living in the house in directories as well. While the males of the family usually had sales jobs such as a car dealer or a brewery, the women held stenography or secretarial positions. The house has had several different owners since the O’Callaghan family sold it in 1965.</em></p>
<p><em>The Manfred E. Nichols House is part of the Hillside Avenue Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 21, 1975 and which was made a local historic district on February 15, 1985.</em></p>
<p><em>Coburn &amp; Sons, Architects</em></p>
<p><em>Previous research included in the 1975 area inventory form provides an attribution of Coburn &amp; Sons, but the information is not cited. The firm, known alternatively as Coburn &amp; Son and J.L. Coburn &amp; Son was active principally in Lewiston, Maine. The firm included Jefferson Lake Coburn (1835-1917), a carpenter, builder, contractor and architect based in Lewiston and sons Forest G. Coburn (1871-1894) and Leon Coburn (1869-1897); the 1887 Lewiston City Directory lists both in their father’s office with the occupation “draftsman.” They are cited for designing a large masonry commercial building at 129 Lisbon Street in Lewiston, Maine, known as the Osgood Building, and a residence in Auburn on Minot Avenue for W.W. Stetson in 1889.</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <em>They also designed a residence for James C. Lord at 497 Main Street in Lewiston in 1885 (NRIND 7/21/1978). The nomination indicates that J.L. Coburn served in the Civil War as a lieutenant in the 1<sup>st</sup> Maine Cavalry and “executed commissions in Presque Isle and Vassalboro as well as in his local area.”</em></p>
