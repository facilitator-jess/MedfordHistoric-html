# HTML to JSON Extraction Summary

## What Was Accomplished

Successfully extracted structured data from 30 HTML files containing historical property records from the Medford Historical Commission and converted them to JSON format.

## Files Created

### Scripts
- `extract_tables.py` - Main extraction script
- `analyze_data.py` - Data analysis script
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README_extraction.md` - Detailed instructions

### Output Data
- `json_data/` directory containing:
  - 30 individual JSON files (one per property)
  - `all_properties.json` - Combined dataset

## Data Structure

Each property JSON contains:
- **Metadata**: Recorder, organization, date
- **Property Info**: Address, historic name, construction date, style, condition, etc.
- **Images**: Photo and map references
- **Descriptions**: Architectural and historical narratives (when available)

## Key Statistics

- **Total Properties**: 30
- **Properties with Images**: 27/30 (90%)
- **Most Common Streets**: Hillside Avenue (20 properties)
- **Most Common Style**: Colonial Revival (3 properties)
- **Most Common Construction Period**: 1889-1898 (4 properties)
- **Most Common Condition**: Fair (14 properties)

## Data Quality Notes

- All properties have basic information extracted
- Image paths are preserved as they appear in HTML
- Text is cleaned and normalized
- Some properties may have missing descriptions due to HTML structure variations

## Usage

To run the extraction:
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
python extract_tables.py
```

To analyze the data:
```bash
python analyze_data.py
```

## Next Steps

The JSON data is now ready for:
- Database import
- API development
- Data analysis
- Web application development
- Geographic visualization

The structured format makes it much easier to work with than the original HTML files.
