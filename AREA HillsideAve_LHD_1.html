<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural, structural and landscape features and evaluate in terms of other areas within the community</em>.</p>
<p>Because each building in the Hillside Area LHD has been documented on individual MHC Inventory Forms, this description will be limited in scope and is intended to briefly describe the general character of the district. For complete descriptions and histories of each building in the district, individual forms should be consulted. It should also be noted that the National Register district boundaries vary somewhat from the boundaries of the Local Historic District. The LHD was expanded in 2002 in order to include newer properties within the subdivision of formerly historically associated lots on Pilgrim Road, Governors Avenue and the south side of Grandview Avenue.</p>
<p>The neighborhood is perched on the steep south slope of Pasture Hill. It was among the first planned subdivisions to be constructed north of High Street and west of Medford Square, and was certainly sited to take advantage of its spectacular view shed. The uniformly single-family houses were arranged on three rectangular blocks on both sides of Hillside and Grandview avenues. Unlike some contemporary and many later developments, with curvilinear lanes inspired by the theories promulgated by the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted, Hillside’s two lanes are composed of straight lines with tight corners that form rectangular blocks and lots.</p>
<p>The Hillside Avenue vicinity was initially developed during the 1890s with large, commodious suburban villas generally known as what have come to be termed “Comfortable Houses” by Alan Gowans (admittedly, in Hillside, toward the upper end of the socio-economic spectrum).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The Comfortable House was distinguished from its predecessors by several attributes: its materials, construction and planning were often manufactured and standardized; it was distinctly suburban, rather than rural, in character; and, most importantly, it had modern conveniences such as electricity, plumbing and privacy. Comfortable houses were designed to be used in a “rational” manner and to be run as servant-less, or, as in Hillside, as reduced-staff households. The difference in the character of the Hillside Avenue neighborhood to the alternative, what could be defined as rural estate planning, becomes apparent by comparing the neighborhood with its surroundings during the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Immediately to the east and north was an extensive area of large rural estates owned by local elites including the Lawrence, Bradlee and Hall families, among others, which generally do not survive. These properties were characterized by large, elaborate houses with complexes of outbuildings on expansive landscaped lots, often with limited ancillary agriculture. In contrast the buildings of Hillside, though large, are located on minimal suburban lots which, with only two exceptions, lacked any supportive outbuildings (these outbuildings were quickly converted to alternative uses or later demolished; alternatively several properties in Hillside later added small garages). Rather than functioning as country retreats for a leisured class, they housed career professionals who commuted or travelled for work. The neighborhood’s very existence, in fact, depended on nearby rail and streetcar transportation. The neighborhood later underwent a second and third phase of expansion after the introduction of automobile transportation.</p>
<p>One outstanding exception to this model is the first house constructed in the area c. 1881-1882, the <strong>Hastings/Perry/Warner House</strong> at <strong>35 Hillside Avenue (c. 1881-1882, MDF.26)</strong>. This house, which is noticeably larger and more elaborate than the rest, was sited on what was originally a substantially larger lot at arguably the choicest location within the subdivision. It is a highly stylized, eclectic example of a blend of the Shingle and Queen Anne styles. Rectangularly massed under a side gable with a prominent “M”-shaped façade composed of two gabled wall dormers, it encloses five bays across the front and is two piles deep. Its most prominent decorative features include a broad, low elliptical archway that shelters a recessed center entrance, two prominent projecting oriel bays in the second of two-and-a-half levels, and a relief carving in the center of the façade depicting a sheaf of wheat in deep relief. The house’s <em>date makes it contemporary with seminal regional and national examples of the Shingle style, including the Stoughton House at Cambridge and the Isaac Bell house at Newport, although this house shows more influence of the slightly more established Queen Anne style than either of those two examples. Nonetheless, its early date of construction and sophisticated massing and ornamental schemes suggests the work of an architect engaged in the latest architectural fashion. The identity of such an architect has not yet been determined.</em></p>
<p>The rest of the neighborhood’s housing stock from its initial period of development during the 1890s, which dominates the built landscape and is in a condition of good preservation, is remarkably uniform in scale and architectural elaboration. The buildings are compactly massed around, generally, between eight and twelve rooms on two-and-a-half levels. Several examples embrace picturesque massing through the employment of a tower or observatory, a feature that made sense given the dramatic topography that afforded views as far as Boston. These towered examples include <strong>15 Hillside Avenue, the C.H. Webster House (1890-1893, MDF.388), 26 Hillside Avenue, the Hervey-Volpe House (1889-1890, MDF.381), 31 Hillside Avenue, the Frank H. Hamilton House (1890-1893, MDF.385), 8 Grandview Avenue, the Manfred E. Nichols House (1889-1890, MDF.390) and 35 Grandview Avenue, the Nicholas White House (1893-1895, MDF.395)</strong>. This first wave of building was nominally designed in styles popular throughout the preceding decades of the 19<sup>th</sup> century including Shingle (<strong>21 Hillside Avenue, the Frank H. Peak House (1890-1898, MDF.387)</strong>, 26, and 35 Hillside Avenue), Queen Anne (15 Hillside Avenue, <strong>16 Hillside Avenue, the Edgar J. Hervey – Coleman J. Manning House (1889-1898, MDF.378)</strong> 20 Hillside avenue, and 31 Hillside Avenue and 8 Grandview Avenue, <strong>27 Grandview Avenue, the Nicholas White Tenant House (1889-1898, MDF.393),</strong> 31 and <strong>36 Grandview Avenue, the Gilbert Hodges House (1890-1893, MDF.392)</strong>), and Colonial Revival (<strong>7 Hillside Avenue, the Fred M. Lamson House (1892-1897, MDF.389)</strong> and <strong>27 Hillside Avenue, the Edward A. Badger House (1890-1898, MDF.386)</strong>). Number 35 Grandview Avenue is a late example of Italianate design executed by a non-professional architect who was a masonry contractor. Although each house can be roughly characterized as reflecting a particular academic style, there is a high degree of eclecticism reflected in the area’s architecture, particularly with regard to the boundary between the Shingle and Queen Anne styles, making classification occasionally ambiguous. Many houses also share conventional features of the period, including stock moldings, window sash and, most predominantly, projecting polygonal bays. On the verge of the Great Depression, in 1928-1930, the last house of this early, elaborate phase of the area’s development was constructed at <strong>34 Governors Avenue, the Antonio Frankini House (1928-1930, MDF.1104)</strong>. Although similar in scale and pretension to the houses built on the other side of the hill forty years earlier, this example, although geographically related, is oriented toward a similar but historically different neighborhood to the east, the Bradlee Hall Estate area (MDF.L). It also differs from its earlier, more picturesque neighbors in the Hillside LHD in terms of style: it is a highly rational, symmetrical example from the Colonial Revival movement.</p>
<p>With the advent of the automobile the area underwent several subsequent phases of limited development that occurred as infill on previously left-over vacant land rather than through demolition and reconstruction. These later phases of building differ in character from the initial development, mostly in terms of scale, reflecting the diminishing expectations of the post-World War II era. The second phase was constructed immediately after the war in 1947 as a small collection of three almost identical side-entry Colonial Revival-style single-family houses near the crest of Pasture Hill on the west side of <strong>Hillside Avenue</strong> at numbers <strong>30, the George T. Leonard House (1947-1948, MDF.382), 32, the Lawrence M. Tura House (1947-1948, MDF.383) and 36, the John J. McCarron House (1947-1948, MDF.384)</strong>. These houses can be classified as variants of the three- or five-bay center-entrance Colonial Revival popular at the time. In this case these smaller examples have a side-entry plan including a living room in the front adjacent to the entry, with a dining area and kitchen in the rear. Each also has a rear porch and a single-bay attached garage positioned at grade on the downhill side of each house. Although all three have undergone minor alteration, including the addition of door hoods or entry porches and sash replacement, they each retain their original massing and tri-part façade fenestration on the first floor.</p>
<p>At the other end of the area near the end of the eastward loop of Grandview Avenue the third phase of development, consisting of only two houses that are distinctly characteristic of the Cold War/Space Age era, was constructed c. 1960. The first, at <strong>26 Grandview Avenue, the Raymond D. Mudd House (1960, MDF.391)</strong> is the simpler of the two: a rectangularly massed gabled ranch. Although slightly altered through the addition of a gabled entry porch, it retains symmetrical picture windows in its façade. Number <strong>37 Grandview Avenue, the Anthony Dingolo House (1961, MDF.396)</strong> is a somewhat more complex variation on the split level. This type is identified by its internal and external plan of two lateral wings ‘split’ in the center by a half-story break; the single-story side, here raised on a half-basement, houses the public, entertaining side of the building while the two-story side generally houses an at-grade garage with private chambers and bath above.</p>
<p>In 1985 a Local Historic District was established matching the National Register District (4/21/1975) boundaries. In 2002 the boundaries were expanded to include lots fronting Governors Avenue to include number 34 and number 10, the headquarters of the Medford Historical Society. Lots on the south side of Grandview Avenue and recently subdivided lots fronting Pilgrim Drive, formerly comprising the rear garden of 35 Hillside Avenue, were added as well.</p>
<p>Between 1989 and 1997 the fourth phase of development in the area took place in the form of three single-family houses facing onto a cul-de-sac at the end of Pilgrim Road. These properties were included in the district because they are sited on land formerly part of the rear garden of the largest and earliest house in the Hillside development at 35 Hillside Avenue. Two, at <strong>41 Pilgrim Road, the Vittorio Forcellati House (1989, MDF.1120) and 43 Pilgrim Road, the Lawrence F. White House (1997, MDF.1121)</strong>, are recent examples of the five-bay, two-story Colonial Revival form. The third, at <strong>39 Pilgrim Road, the Joseph J. Maggiore, Jr. House (1989, MDF.1119)</strong> is more difficult to classify with regard to style. It is a hip-block building with multiple projecting gabled pavilions on both the first and smaller, clerestory-like second level. The decorative arched components of the paired casement windows are vaguely reminiscent of a Palladian or Venetian window, lending the house an affinity to Classicism which could be considered a manifestation of Post Modernism. This house, including the most-recent constructed in the area described below, resemble the houses McAlester has recently christened the “Millennium Mansion.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Most recently, between 2003 and 2005, two large-scale, single-family Colonial Revival houses have been perched on what was previously considered unbuildable land between the southeast bend of <strong>Grandview Avenue at number 25, the Mary B. Held House (2003, MDF.1105)</strong> and <strong>Governors Avenue at number 12, the Mary B. Held House (2005, MDF.1101)</strong>. The first, with numerous gables superimposed on a hip roof, resembles the “Millennium Mansion” type. It is interesting to trace the scale and use of buildings in the district between its original build and the present, which forms an inverse curve as housing is again becoming larger in scale and older buildings are being restored.</p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Explain historical development of the area. Discuss how this relates to the historical development of the community</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Hillside Avenue Local Historic District is generally located within the original boundaries of the estates of Thatcher Magoun and Dr. Daniel Swan. Magoun (1775-1856), the well-documented ship builder and Boston shipping merchant, owned most of the land as it appeared in 1855.</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <em>Magoun’s house, an elaborate Greek Revival mansion that served as the public library until it was demolished in 1958, was located on the site of the present library building at 111 High Street. His property extended up Pasture Hill, and most of the western section of the district, along the east side of Hillside and on Grandview, was associated with his house. The portion of the area to the east (between the north-south leg of Grandview Avenue and Governors Avenue) comprised the estate of Dr. Daniel Swan (see 1855 atlas, below, figure 1). Swan (1781 – Dec. 5, 1864), was an important figure in the early 19<sup>th</sup>-century history of Medford. Trained as a physician at Harvard College, graduating in 1803, he served as the town’s doctor between 1816 and his death at a time when the position was an elected post. His fortuitous marriage to Sarah Preston on May 25, 1821, the daughter of wealthy Boston merchant Remember Preston, whose fortune she inherited, allowed him to care for the town’s poorest inhabitants on an eleemosynary basis, for which he was well known and highly regarded.</em><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><em>By 1875 Hillside Avenue had been constructed to access a subdivision planned for the south slope of Pasture Hill that remained in the ownership of Thatcher Magoun, Jr. (1808-1883), a business partner of his father, who resided on the south side of High Street (see MDF.AQ) and his sister, Mrs. Martha Bradshaw Magoun Adams (1812-1885). The Magoun subdivision is reproduced below as figure 2; it demonstrates that this division of land, with a few minor transfers, was largely executed as designed. By this time the estate of Dr. Swan had been divided: the northern portion sold to Nicholas White and the south portion, which was adjacent to the Old High School on High Street, to the town of Medford. The subdivision was slow to develop, however. Almost no buildings had been constructed on Hillside Avenue as late as 1889, by which time the former Magoun land west of Hillside Avenue had been sold to Frank Hervey (1838 – Feb. 10, 1918). The single exception was the lot with the most advantageous view at the northern terminus of <strong>Hillside Avenue at number 35</strong>, upon which the <strong>Hastings/Perry Warner House (MDF.26)</strong> had been constructed by <strong>1882</strong>. The subdivision plan depicted in Figure 2 below demonstrates that the site of this house had been sold by the heirs of Thatcher Magoun to John W. Hastings prior to the design of the subdivision. Hastings (1819-1883) was the son of the prominent Edmund T. Hastings (1789 – 1861), who lived in an Asher Benjamin-designed house in West Medford. The Hastings family is associated with the development of that part of Medford, and is the family for whom Hastings Park is named. In 1880, immediately prior to the construction of the house on Hillside Ave, Hastings lived on Mystic Street in West Medford with his wife Sarah, his son Edmund T. (1851-1886), an 1876 Harvard College graduate named for his grandfather and uncle, as well as two servants. The Hastings’ estate was worth at least $100,000 at this date.</em></p>
<p><em>Immediately after 1890 all three subdivisions, those of Nicholas White, the Magoun Estate, and Frank Hervey, were rapidly developed. By 1898 White had constructed two houses at <strong>27 Grandview Avenue (Nicholas White Tenant House, 1889-1898) and 31 Grandview Avenue</strong> <strong>(Albert W. Ellis House, 1889-1898)</strong> and his own residence at <strong>35 Grandview Avenue (1893-1895)</strong>. Seven of the eight lots of the Magoun Estate subdivision at <strong>15 Hillside Avenue (C.H. Webster House,</strong> <strong>21 Hillside Avenue (Frank H. Peak House, 1890-1898), 27 Hillside Avenue (Edward A. Badger House, 1890-1898), 31 Hillside Avenue (Frank H. Hamilton House, 1890-1893) 8 Grandview Avenue (Manfred E. Nichols House, 1889-1890) and 36 Grandview Avenue (Gilbert Hodges House, 1890-1893)</strong> had been sold and improved. And Frank Hervey had constructed four houses within his own subdivision at <strong>16 Hillside Avenue (Hervey-Manning House, 1889-1898), 20 Hillside Avenue (Nels H. Seaburg House, 1889-1898), 24 Hillside Avenue (Edward Archibald Patterson House, 1889-1897) and 26 Hillside Avenue (Hervey-Volpe House, 1889-1890)</strong> and sold a fourth lot to Charles H. Webster. Map evidence and occupancy patterns indicate that both White and Hervey retained ownership of their lots and houses for a number of years, while the Magoun subdivision appears to have been sold to individual property owners who executed their own improvements. The initial owners of these individual properties are identified in the individual MHC Inventory forms associated with this area.</em></p>
<p><em>No additional development took place within the area of the LHD until 1947, when three identical single-family Colonial Revival houses at <strong>30 Hillside Avenue (George T. Leonard House), 32 Hillside Avenue (Lawrence M. Tura House) and 36 Hillside Avenue (John J. McCarron House)</strong> were constructed by local builder Gerard P. Friel in <strong>1947-1948</strong> (see figure 3, below). In <strong>c. 1960</strong> the last remaining open lots within the former Magoun subdivision at <strong>26 Grandview Avenue (Raymond D. Mudd House)</strong> and <strong>37 Grandview Avenue (Anthony Dingolo House)</strong> were improved with single-family houses. Between 1989 and 1997 three single family houses were constructed in the rear yard of 35 Hillside Avenue at <strong>39 Pilgrim Road (Joseph J. Maggiore, Jr. House, 1989), 41 Pilgrim Road (Vittorio Forcellati House, 1989) and 43 Pilgrim Road (Lawrence F. White House, 1997)</strong>. The most recent construction took place on two formerly town-owned lots between the southeast bend of Grandview Avenue and Governors Avenue on steep, previously undevelopable land at <strong>25 Grandview Avenue (2003) and 12 Governors Avenue (2005)</strong> both for then-owner <strong>Mary B. Held</strong>. At this time, a new building to be added to the last open land in the district, between 12 and 34 Governors Avenue, is under review by the district commission.</em></p>
<p>The area was initially surveyed in 1975 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a district 4/21/1975. A Local Historic District was established in 1985. The LHD was expanded beyond the boundaries of the NRDIST to include lots fronting the west side of Governors Avenue and the south side of Grandview Avenue in 2002 (see locus map below).</p>
