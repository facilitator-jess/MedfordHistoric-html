<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Antonio Frankini House is an impressive Colonial Revival building highly representative of its style. The brick house sits on a stone foundation and has an asphalt shingle roof. It is a two-story, double-pile building capped by a hipped roof with its entry centered in a five-bay main façade. The main mass of the house is flanked by single-story side porches, both enclosed; the left has paired sash divided by mullions, and the right, formerly open, has an elaborate stone balustrade, with fixed single-pane picture windows. Beneath the enclosed porch on the right is the house’s single-bay garage at the basement level. The two side porches have a short balustrade of square balusters running around the edges of their flat roofs. A hip-roofed dormer with two windows is centered on the forward slope of the roof.</em></p>
<p><em>The Frankini House is an example of an ambitious Colonial Revival house typical of its construction date, and it was likely built as a showpiece for the building’s owner, who was in the construction trade, especially the stonework. The nine-over-nine and six-over-six sash windows have sandstone sills with brick splayed lintels with sandstone keystones. All of the windows on the main body of the house have two-panel louvered shutters. A striking demi-lune stone balustrade runs in front of the main entrance stoop and around the enclosed porch on the north elevation. The main entry has a traditional Colonial Revival treatment. The centered main entry door is framed by full-height sidelights with tracery capped by a segmental arched fanlight. A half-round porch shelters the entry. It is supported at the front by two fluted Doric-order columns which are mimicked at the wall by paired fluted pilasters. The porch roof has a wide entablature with modillions supporting an overhanging cornice. The modillions are an echo of the rafter tails that are visible under the open-soffit eaves of the main roof. An oversized flag pole projects from the front of the house, above the entry porch.</em></p>
<p><em>The Frankini House is sited at the base of a steep hill on a terraced lot. It is elevated above the street by a stone retaining wall. A retaining wall of the same stone is built to the north of the house, carving out a space for the driveway. Smaller terraces above this use different, darker stone. The whole lot is elaborately landscaped, mostly with small shrubs. In front of the house to the south is a large rock with the legend "BUILT ON ROCK" carved into it, likely a form of advertising for the builder of the house, and a very apt statement, as the house is built on and supported by rock.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Antonio Frankini House was likely built as a display of its owners work between 1928 and 1930. The land the Frankini House sits on was earlier part of the estate of Nicholas White, a stonemason who resided at the crown of Pasture Hill directly behind the subject property at 35 Grandview Avenue (MDF.395). An Irish immigrant who came to Medford in 1850, White became a prominent stonemason, laying the foundations of a number of prominent buildings around the city.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Grace Episcopal church, the foundation for the Opera house building and Odd Fellows’ hall, the public library [this likely refers to the 1890s addition in brick], the First Baptist church, of Malden, and the old St. Mary’s church, of Malden, were built under his supervision. He also constructed the water and sewer systems of the towns of Hull and Nantucket [almost certainly an error; should instead read "Nantasket"], and many buildings for Engineer Bowditch, of Boston. He was employed in the laying out of the large estates and land in the wealthy residential section of the town of Lenox. For several years he was road commissioner when Medford was a town.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>White was also active in various community organizations, particularly Irish groups like the Ancient Order of the Hibernians. While attending events marking George Washington’s birthday in 1907, White took a short fall down a set of stairs, and died several days later. By 1910 the eastern portion of White’s estate, comprised of a subdivision that included his own house at 35 Grandview Avenue, 27 Grandview Avenue (MDF.286) and 31 Grandview Avenue (MDF.394) had been split to form a separate lot to accommodate the subject house shown on a subdivided lot on a 1936 Sanborn map.</em></p>
<p><em>Antonio Frankini (b. 1901), was the original owner and builder of the subject house. Frankini and his brother Mauro (1899-1966) owned Frankini Brothers Co. Inc., a general contracting and engineering firm. Among the firm’s local attributions were an apartment house at 148 High Street (1931, see MDF.1115) and the Medford Cooperative Bank at 60 High Street (1931, see MDF.1112), both large, complex buildings. By the 1920s Frankini, an Italian immigrant, was living in Medford with his wife Amelia, their two daughters, Yolanda and Livia, and his mother-in-law, Margaret Greco. In 1928 the Frankinis were living at 74 Swan Street with Antonio’s brother Mauro. Between 1928 and 1930 the family moved into their new house on Governors Avenue, likely built by Frankini Brothers. After Amelia Frankini’s death in 1988, her daughter Yolanda Torrice inherited the property. Yolanda Torrice sold the family house in 2004 to new owners.</em></p>
<p><em>The Antonio Frankini House was added to the Hillside Avenue Historic District in 2002. The district was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 21, 1975; the original local historic district was established on February 15, 1985.</em></p>
