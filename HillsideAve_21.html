<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Frank H. Peak House is a large, complex, side-gable Shingle Style house with a number of projections, typical of the style. Its massive side-gable profile, with a roof that encloses two-and-a-half stories above the ground floor, is reminiscent of the well-known William G. Low House of Bristol, Rhode Island, a seminal example of the style designed by McKim, Mead and White; in this example the gable is on the visible side elevation rather than the façade. The house is covered in painted wood shingles and has an asphalt shingle roof. It is three-and-a-half stories tall and two rooms wide, with the main entry placed in the left bay of the main façade. At the front of the house, the roof extends beyond the front wall to cover a recessed porch that runs across the width of the house. Thick square posts support the porch, with a balustrade of simple square balusters. The front slope of the roof is dominated by a large dormer; a pedimented roof with an oval window on its face is supported by a polygonal bay flanked by flush windows. The rear of the house is covered by a large cross-gable, extending the height of the second story and providing a third level of living space under a steep gable. Assessor’s records and maps, as well as the photograph, suggest that the southeast, rear right corner of the house is an enclosed recessed porch, a common feature on Shingle Style houses. Other massing features on the house include a single-story polygonal wing with a hipped roof extending beyond the front pile of the left elevation. The right elevation is enlivened by numerous projecting polygonal bays of varying heights; a two-story bay is located in the forward pile and a single-story bay in the rear. The third story is lit by a complex composition of paired polygonal oriels separated by a decorative panel. Both are supported by large horizontal console brackets. A gable formed by a continuation of the main ridge of the roof beyond the side of the house shelters the whole. The house appears on maps in its current configuration as early as 1903, suggesting it has had no major exterior alterations. The windows on the house are eight-over one modern replacement sash.</em></p>
<p><em>Sited on the east side of Hillside Avenue, the Peak House faces west across the street. The house sits very high up on a hill above the street, with a steeply-sloped front yard. The small size of the lot, the large size of the house, and the steep hillside location has left little room for landscaping or mature trees. The lot is small enough that it does not incorporate a driveway.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>Although Hillside Avenue was laid out as early as 1875, it was not developed until the closing years of the century. The steep hillside location and sweeping views down into Medford and Boston give the two neighborhood streets their names: Hillside and Grandview avenues (although an early plan shows Grandview as Patten Street). The neighborhood was developed in the 1890s as a cluster of mostly Queen Anne style single-family houses on small lots. During much of the 19<sup>th</sup> century the land belonged to Thatcher Magoun (17 June 1775 – 16 April 1856), a prominent Medford ship builder and merchant. After his death, his two surviving children, Thatcher Magoun, Jr. (4 August 1808 – 27 May 1883) and Martha Bradshaw Magoun Adams (17 October 1812 – 13 June 1885), inherited the property, and are marked as the owners on the 1875 atlas.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>In 1890, a plan was filed with the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds dividing the land on the east side of Hillside Avenue into nine lots, and laying out Grandview Avenue, what was then called Patten Street. Martha Bradshaw Magoun Adams inherited the land after her brother’s death, as the plan covers land belonging to "Mrs. M. B. Adams."</em></p>
<p><em>The Frank H. Peak House has had a number of owners during its history, and its large size has led to a number of large families (and boarders) living in the house. The house first appears on maps in 1898, with Mrs. L. E. Peak listed as the owner; this was Frank H.Peak’s wife, Lucille E.; however the Peaks were likely at the address the year before, when they are listed as living on Hillside Avenue in the 1897 directory. Peak (d. Jul. 26, 1932) was a news dealer and is listed in directories as operating a men’s variety store at 13 Riverside Avenue, with men’s furnishings, cigars, and other similar items. The Peaks were listed in the 1900 census at the address with their five children, Frank’s mother, and a Canadian servant. The family was still living in the house when the 1910 census was taken, but by 1914 they were living at 49 Summer Street.</em></p>
<p><em>By 1918 Joseph F. and Mary Sheffield had moved their family into the house. While the couple was young and only had a 2-year-old son in the 1920 census, they were living with Mary’s brother, his wife and two children, as well as three boarders. Joseph F. Sheffield was listed as a helper in a machine shop, while his brother-in-law was a salesman in a dry good store.</em></p>
<p><em>The Sheffield family had moved on by the time the 1930 census was taken, by which time the Lynch family was living in the Peak House. Margaret Lynch and her four sons, all in their 20s, were listed at the address that year. The Lynch brothers had a variety of occupations: real estate agent, pool room manager, golf instructor, and president of the Gage Co. (about which no information is available).</em></p>
<p><em>By 1938 the Peak House became occupied by members of the McArdle family, including sisters Margaret, Agnes and Alice. Before moving to the Peak House, Margaret and her family lived next door, at 21 Hillside Avenue. In 1940 the census listed Margaret McArdle, her son, her daughter Margaret, and her daughter’s husband and child; another daughter, with her husband and two children; and Margaret’s two sisters Agnes and Alice. Alice was listed as divorced, and while Margaret McArdle was listed as married, her husband was not living in the house.</em></p>
<p><em>The Frank H. Peak House is part of the Hillside Avenue Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 21, 1975 and which was made a local historic district on February 15, 1985</em></p>
