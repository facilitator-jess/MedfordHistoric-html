<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Albert W. Ellis House is a large single-family Queen Anne-style house typical of others in the neighborhood constructed during the 1890s. The two-and-a-half story, two-bay-wide, three-pile-deep end house sits on a cut stone foundation, is covered in vinyl siding, and has an asphalt shingle roof. The house has dramatic, picturesque massing on its south (right) elevation in the form of a broad, three-story polygonal bay in the center pile that rises three-and-a-half stories to form a tower observatory that takes advantage of the site’s south-facing views. A second single-story polygonal bay is located in the forward pile. Behind the tower toward the rear is a double-deck enclosed porch that appears to be an early addition. The opposite side of the house has a projecting, cornice-height cross-gable located in the center pile. Large pedimented dormers light the attic level in each slope of the forward pile. The main entrance to the house is in the north bay of the main façade, and is covered by a single-story open porch with a flat roof. Two Doric-order columns support the porch, and a cast iron balustrade, likely a later addition, runs along the edge of the porch roof.</em></p>
<p><em>The cut stone used to construct the chimney that takes up the south half of the main façade matches the stone used to construct the house to the north at 35 Grandview Avenue. A similar cut stone chimney is just barely visible exiting the ridgeline towards the rear of the house. Most of the windows on the house have been replaced with modern one-over-one sash, although it appears a few original two-over-one sash were retained and are a protected by storm windows. Like many Queen Anne houses, it was likely covered in multiple siding materials; a slight flare between the first and second stories was maintained when the house was covered in vinyl siding.</em></p>
<p><em>The Albert W. Ellis House sits on the east side of Grandview Avenue, facing west across the street. The house is sited on a minimal lot at a slight setback; the main entry porch abuts the sidewalk. This is likely a result of the steep slope of the site; at the rear of the house, the land dips sharply away from the building. Because of the tight lot there is no landscaping around the house. The land to the south of the house is paved for a driveway.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>Although the Albert W. Ellis House appears as a cohesive part of its neighborhood, it was actually developed separately from many of the neighboring houses. Built between 1889 and 1898, the Albert W. Ellis House was one of three located on a parcel of land on the east side of Grandview Avenue owned by Nicholas White. The land to the west, including the west side of Grandview Avenue and all of Hillside Avenue, was a separate subdivision laid out about the same time White had his three houses built.</em></p>
<p><em>The house’s builder, developer and early owner, Nicholas White ( was an Irish immigrant who came to Medford in 1850. White became a prominent stonemason, laying the foundations of a number of prominent buildings around the city.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Grace Episcopal church, the foundation for the Opera house building and Odd Fellows’ hall, the public library [this likely refers to the 1890s addition in brick], the First Baptist church, of Malden, and the old St. Mary’s church, of Malden, were built under his supervision. He also constructed the water and sewer systems of the towns of Hull and Nantucket [almost certainly an error; should instead read "Nantasket"], and many buildings for Engineer Bowditch, of Boston. He was employed in the laying out of the large estates and land in the wealthy residential section of the town of Lenox. For several years he was road commissioner when Medford was a town.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>White was also active in various community organizations, particularly Irish groups like the Ancient Order of the Hibernians. While attending events marking George Washington’s birthday in 1907, White took a short fall down a set of stairs, and died several days later.</em></p>
<p><em>While White built (presumably himself) an impressive stone house at the top of the hill (MDF.395), two less ornate Queen Anne style houses were built to the south of his residence, including 27 Grandview Avenue (MDF286) and the subject building. The Albert W. Ellis House was one of these houses, built immediately to the south of the White House but set close to Grandview Road unlike the White House which is set back from the street. The Ellis House first appears on maps in 1898, as part of Nicholas White’s property; no other owner is listed. The 1900 census lists Frank Hervey, his wife Olive, and their servant at the address. However for most of the early part of the century, Hervey lived at 26 Hillside Avenue (MDF.381), as he owned land on the west side of that street. As early as the 1890s he is listed there, so it is unclear why the census places him at this house in 1900.</em></p>
<p><em>By 1909 Albert W. Ellis had moved into the house with his family. The change in ownership was likely precipitated by the death of Nicholas White in 1907. Around the time of White’s death, the Ellis House was split off from the larger White parcel, along with the second Queen Anne house to the south at 27 Grandview Avenue (MDF.286). Ellis is listed in the 1910 census at the address with his wife Alma, three daughters, and a son. The Ellis family is listed in census returns at the address through 1940, although by 1930 the Ellis children had moved out and Mr. and Mrs. Ellis were living in the house alone. Ellis (1871-1944) was an advertising agent and principal of his own firm with an office in Boston. He was fairly prominent in the field of advertising, having been a founder of the American Association of Advertising Agencies and a charter member of the National Outdoor Advertising Bureau. Ellis was also deeply involved in a number of genealogical societies and other social organizations, including the Massachusetts Society of the Order of the Founders and Patriots of America, the Massachusetts Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, the Society of the War of 1812, the Medford Historical Society, the Omar Kayyam Club and the Chili Club.</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>In 1951, N. Stanley Ellis, acting as executor for his mother Alma’s estate, sold the property. The house passed through another set of owners before the current owners, Frederick A. Bucchi and his wife Michelina, purchased the property in 1964. Although built as a single-family, the Ellis House currently houses two-families.</em></p>
<p><em>The Albert W. Ellis House is part of the Hillside Avenue Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 21, 1975 and which was made a local historic district on February 15, 1985.</em></p>
<p><em>John Nolan, builder</em></p>
<p><em>John Nolan is listed as the builder of the Albert W. Ellis house on the 1975 MHC Inventory Area Form. This attribution is not cited, but appears to come from "Medford Building Records." Nolan is also listed as the builder of the house to the south, 27 Grandview Avenue (MDF.393). A John Nolan is listed as a carpenter in the 1897 Medford directory, but it is unclear if this is the same John Nolan that built the two houses. No other information is available about Nolan.</em></p>
