<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Frank Hervey House is a large single-family Queen Anne-style end house with half-timbering in the gable ends that gives it a touch of the related Tudor style. It is a near twin to its neighbor to the north at 20 Hillside Avenue (MDF.282). Like many of its neighbors, the house was constructed between 1889 and 1898. The two-and-a-half story gabled block is oriented with its narrow end to the street and its long wall includes its primary entry and ornament and provides views down High Street. The house has numerous projections and bays, typical of the Queen Anne style. The south elevation is highlighted by three two-story polygonal bays; while the center bay has a flat roof, the two end bays are capped by gables. The main entry, enclosed within a single-story porch with a flat roof, is in the forward bay. An open porch connected to the enclosed porch runs across the building’s main façade. A wide polygonal bay with a flat roof and an open porch connected to the enclosed porch runs across the building’s street-facing façade. On the building’s north elevation, the roof extends in the shape of a shed over the rear two-thirds of the elevation, covering a shallow projection.</em></p>
<p><em>The house sits on a cut stone foundation, is covered in painted wood shingles, and has an asphalt shingle roof. As noted above, the house is given a Tudor appearance by half-timbering in the gable ends on the main façade and on the two small gables on the south elevation. Other decorative details include the Tuscan-order columns that support the enclosed entrance porch and the stepped chimney stack. The gable end of the main façade overhangs the lower stories slightly and is supported by two simple curved brackets of substantial heft. Most of the windows on the house are six-over-one replacement sash, although original windows are found in a few locations. In the main gable end as well as the two south elevation gables have one-over-one sash, with the top sash composed of diamond panes. On the north elevation, a one-over-one sash window has a stained glass upper sash; the windows placement between stories suggests it is the location of a stair landing. A few smaller fixed-pane sash composed of six panes are also found on the north elevation.</em></p>
<p><em>To the south of the house is a small brick and concrete detached garage, typical of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. It is covered by overgrown trees and is not immediately noticeable from the street. The house fills most of its very small (less than a tenth of an acre) lot on the west side of the street.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The subject property is located within the original boundaries of the estate of Thatcher Magoun (1775-1856), the well-documented ship builder and Boston shipping merchant, as it appeared in 1855.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>By 1875 Hillside Avenue had been constructed to serve a subdivision located on the south slope of Pasture Hill that remained in the ownership of Thatcher Magoun, Jr. (1808-1883), a business partner of his father, and his sister, Mrs. Martha Bradshaw Magoun Adams (1812-1885). The subdivision was slow to develop, however. No buildings had been constructed on Hillside Avenue as late as 1889, by which time the former Magoun land west of the avenue had been sold to Frank Hervey (1838 – Feb. 10, 1918).</em></p>
<p><em>Frank Hervey was a prominent local merchant and proprietor of the Boston Branch grocery at 11 Main Street between 1890 until at least 1916, he later brought his nephew, Edgar J. Hervey, who took over management and changed the name to Edgar J. Hervey Co. upon his uncle’s retirement. Frank Hervey was also a veteran of the Civil War.</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>As early as 1890 Frank Hervey resided at 4 Hillside Avenue, today 26 Hillside Avenue (MDF.381). By 1898 Hervey had constructed two other houses on his property at numbers 16 and 20.</em></p>
<p><em>Hervey family members lived in the house during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Frank Hervey is listed at the address in a 1909 directory. During the 1910s, Julia A. Hervey lived in the house; she was the widow of James A. Anger, who was the Medford Supervisor of Schools (d. 1905), and was a sister of Frank and an aunt to Edgar. The 1920 census enumerates Edgar J. Hervey at the address with his family: Maude, his wife; Chester A. and Wade S., his sons; Marion, a daughter; his aunt, Julia, who had been living in the house for several years; and an Irish servant, Bridget Gagan.</em></p>
<p><em>The house was sold out of the Hervey family in the early 1920s; Coleman J. Manning and his family were listed at the address by 1924. That year, Manning was living with his wife Mary E., their daughters Ether M., Mary E., and Helen G., and their sons Franklin J. and Ralph F. The 1930 census records Manning, his wife, and their adult daughter Esther at the address. Although earlier directories list Manning as a foreman and a gauge maker, he is listed in the 1930 census as a bank broker. Manning died in 1930; his wife sold the house to new owners in 1944, and it has had a series of owners since then.</em></p>
<p><em>The Hervey-Manning House is part of the Hillside Avenue Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 21, 1975 and which was made a local historic district on February 15, 1985.</em></p>
<p><em>John W. Russell, probable architect</em></p>
<p><em>A 1970s area form of the Hillside Avenue Historic District identifies John W. Russell as the architect of both 16 and 20 Hillside Avenue, both similar architecturally and both constructed for Frank Hervey, suggesting Russell designed all three. Directories from the time show that Russell lived in Medford and had an office on Tremont Street in Boston. John W. Russell (b. c. 1852) resided in a boarding house at 68 Ashland Street between 1890 and 1930. He maintained offices in Boston at 5 Pemberton Square during the 1890s and 110 Tremont Street between 1920 and 1930. Although little is known regarding Russell’s training, his partner between 1905 and 1927, Henry Preston Clark (1853-1927) was educated at M.I.T. and the Academy des Beaux Arts in Paris, the pinnacle of architectural training worldwide during the late-19<sup>th</sup> century. The firm received commissions for a number of high-profile buildings and residences in the region, including the Public Library of Hyde Park at 35 Harvard Avenue, Boston (BOS.10957), 15 Channing Place, Cambridge (1899), the W.C. English House (1912), the Teresa A. Crowley House (1909, 86 Dean Road, BKL.1533) and the Hermann F. Clarke House (1916, 420 Warren Street, BKL.1276), the last three in Brookline.</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
