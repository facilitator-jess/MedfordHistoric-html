<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Colonial Revival style of the Edward A. Badger House differs from its Queen Anne neighbors, although all the houses were constructed during the 1890s. In contrast to their complex, asymmetrical, picturesque aesthetic, the two-and-a-half story, double-pile Badger House emphasizes symmetry and rationality in its compact massing under a hip roof. The façade and side elevations have large, widely spaced openings, and its large expanses of flat wall provide another contrast to others in the area. The first floor of the main façade is covered by an enclosed single-story porch with a flat roof. The elevated central bay of the porch and its balcony functions as a formal entrance pavilion. The full porch is not depicted on maps through 1936, suggesting it was added during the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century; maps do show the elaborated central section. Additional massing is provided by a two-story, single-pile rear ell that is two rooms wide with a flat roof. The ell is visible on a map from 1900, suggesting it is original. There are three gabled dormers on the main façade of the roof and a single gabled dormer centered on the rear slope. On the rear pile of the south elevation is a two-story polygonal bay. The house sits on a parged concrete foundation, is covered in stucco, and has an asphalt shingle roof. Two brick chimneys – exit the roof, one on the rear of the house, and the second centered on the south elevation.</em></p>
<p><em>A few Colonial Revival decorative features are found on the house. The main cornice is lined by modillions and smaller dentils. The hipped roof is capped by an open observatory, also popularly known as a widow’s walk, surrounded by a balustrade that matches the one found on the roof of the enclosed porch. On the second floor of the main façade, the center window is an oval oculus window. Metal awnings cover the other two windows. The windows on the house are mostly two-over-two sash protected by storm windows, although six-over-two sash are visible on the north elevation of the house.</em></p>
<p><em>The Badger House faces west across Hillside Avenue, at its intersection with Grandview Avenue, which marks the northern boundary of the lot. The Badger House’s lot is small and very steep, with a large hill leading up to the front of the house. A few mature trees and shrubs surround the house, and a small wood frame one-car, end-gable detached garage is located on the north side of the house. It was built as a single-family house, but serves as a two-family today.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>Although Hillside Avenue was laid out as early as 1875, it was not developed until the closing years of the century. The steep hillside location and sweeping views down into Medford and Boston give the two neighborhood streets their names: Hillside and Grandview avenues (although an early plan shows Grandview as Patten Street). The neighborhood was developed in the 1890s as a cluster of mostly Queen Anne style single-family houses on small lots. During the 19<sup>th</sup> century the land belonged to Thatcher Magoun (17 Jun 1775 – 16 Apr 1856), a prominent Medford merchant. After his death, his two surviving children, Thatcher Magoun (4 Aug 1808 – 27 May 1883) and Martha Bradshaw Magoun Adams (17 Oct 1812 – 13 Jun 1885), inherited the property, and are marked as the owners on an 1875 map.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>In 1890, a plan was filed with the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds dividing the land on the eats side of Hillside Avenue into nine lots, and laying out what was then called Patten Street. Martha Bradshaw Magoun Adams inherited the land after her brother’s death, as the plan covers land belonging to “Mrs. M. B. Adams.”</em></p>
<p><em>While the exact date of construction is unknown, the Edward A. Badger House first appears on maps in 1898, with Mrs. A. W. Badger listed as the owner. Edward Albert Badger (27 August 1860 – 7 June 1929) was one of Medford’s longest-serving treasurers. His family moved to Medford from Winchester shortly after he was born, settling at 7 Ashland Street. Badger attended Medford schools and studied accounting. His father, Elias W. Badger, was superintendent of Daniel W. Lawrence &amp; Son’s Medford Distillery, and after his death, the son took this position. The younger Badger worked there until the plant closed in 1905; the father’s and son’s combined tenure as superintendent of the distillery lasted for 30 years. Badger then took a position with the state controller of accounts and was placed in charge of all the Middlesex County court accounts; “he not only became thoroughly familiar with this work but inaugurated many improvements in the accounting system then in vogue at the State House [sic].”</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>Badger was appointed Medford city treasurer in November 1910 and held the position until his death.</em></p>
<p><em>Badger married Alice W. Hersey on October 22, 1884. The two had one daughter, Beatrice. Alice W. Badger died on May 10, 1897 of complications from a pregnancy. This event coincided with the family’s likely moved into the house on Hillside Ave., as Mrs. Badger is still listed as the owner on the 1898 map. Edward Badger was known around Medford as an avid walker and bicyclist; “his walking and bicycle riding, the latter dating back to the days of the high wheeled bicycles, made him a familiar figure about the city and surrounding communities.”</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <em>Attendance at Badger’s funeral suggests that he was a beloved city employee. “The service was held at his late residence, with a large attendance from City Hall headed by Mayor Edward H. Larkin and the heads from city departments, also by a large delegation of the Board of Aldermen, headed by President Michael E. O’Brien.”</em><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <em>Four former mayors attended, as well as representatives of Badger’s Masonic lodge.</em></p>
<p><em>Beatrice Badger, daughter of Edward and Alice, was born in Medford on July 20, 1885. She lived with her father her whole life, even after her marriage to Henry S. Perrin, a bank teller by profession, on November 23, 1912. The Badgers and Perrins appear on federal census records at the address from 1900 through 1940. Throughout this period they shared the house with in-laws and multiple generations. In 1900, Edward and Beatrice Badger were living with his sister, Lulu, her husband, Albert E. Covelle (an optician), and an Irish servant, Julia H. Ford. By 1910 the Covelles had moved out, and the Irish servant had been replaced by a Scottish one, Frances Dean. The Perrins had two sons, Badger and David. Ms. Dean was still with the family according to the following census of 1920. After Edward Badger’s death in 1929, the Perrin family was alone in the house, and no longer had a servant living with them. By 1940, the Perrin’s elder son, Badger, had moved out, leaving only Henry, Beatrice, and David Perrin. Henry Perrin listed a Winchester address on his 1942 World War II draft registration card, suggesting the house was sold out of the Badger family after more than 40 years.</em></p>
<p><em>The Badger House is part of the Hillside Avenue Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 21, 1975 and which was made a local historic district on February 15, 1985.</em></p>
