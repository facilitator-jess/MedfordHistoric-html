<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Gilbert Hodges House, constructed between 1890 and 1893, is a large-scale, two-and-a-half story Queen Anne building with complex massing in the form of a large cross gable. The five-bay façade is composed of a slightly projecting gable-front mass to the right and an equally scaled cross gable that extends to the left. The cross gable, with a somewhat lower-pitched gable roof, is broader than the front-facing gable component, which runs through the main body of the building. The 1910 Sanborn atlas demonstrates that the large rear wing is part of the original build. The rear wing, however, is off-set from the front-facing gable, creating a re-entrant angle at the rear corner of the right elevation. The house is accessed through a prominent center entrance that is sheltered by a deep, full-width front porch. Additional massing is provided by multiple cornice-height polygonal bays; one is located in the forward of three piles in the right elevation and the other two, arranged as a matching pair, are located in the left-side elevation of the cross gable. A secondary entrance is located in the face of the forward polygonal bay, and rear entrances are located on either side of the rear wing. A double-deck rear porch is located in the re-entrant angle at the rear-right corner of the building; the first level extending to the side to create a shallow, covered entrance porch. An open, balustraded roof deck, appropriately resembling a period observatory, is located at the intersection of the gables in the center of the roof. This feature appears, however, to be a recent adaptation.</em></p>
<p><em>The house is richly embellished with Queen Anne-style defining characteristics. These include, most prominently, a carved pediment over the porch stoop decorated with floral and seashell motifs in bold relief, the distinctive flared, cased porch posts, and a monumental lancet-shaped blind arch within the main façade gable. Other features include the decorative shingle work in each of the gables. The paired window centered in the third level of the cross gable in the left elevation is recessed within a deep reveal set off by distinctive curved, shingle-clad ‘cheeks.’ The multiple polygonal bays in each side elevation are sheltered by the deep overhangs of the eaves and gables. Multiple hip-roofed dormers pierce each roof slope. The house retains its original large-light front door, but the sash has recently been replaced, by appearance, with six- and eight-over-one aluminum applied-muntin sash.</em></p>
<p><em>The house is sited on a minimal suburban lot at the crest of Pasture Hill in a densely developed neighborhood of large-scale Queen Anne, Shingle and Tudor style houses constructed during the 1890s. There is a moderate degree of mid-20<sup>th</sup>-century through recent infill of single-family suburban housing.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The subject property is located within the original boundaries of the estate of Thatcher Magoun (1775-1856), the well-documented ship builder and Boston shipping merchant, as it appeared in 1855.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Magoun’s house, an elaborate Greek Revival mansion that served as the public library until it was demolished in 1958, was located on the site of the present library building at 111 High Street. By 1875 Hillside Avenue had been constructed to serve a subdivision located on the south slope of Pasture Hill that remained in the ownership of Thatcher Magoun, Jr. (1808-1883), a business partner of his father’s, who resided on the south side of High Street (see MDF.AQ) and his sister, Mrs. Martha Bradshaw Magoun Adams (1812-1885). The subdivision was slow to develop, however. No buildings had been constructed on Hillside Avenue as late as the early 1890s, by which time the former Magoun land west of the avenue had been sold to Frank Hervey (1838 – Feb. 10, 1918).</em></p>
<p><em>The subject house was constructed between 1890 and 1893 for its namesake, Gilbert Hodges (Dec. 8, 1856 – Feb. 13, 1919), a civil engineer by profession. Hodges was the proprietor of his own firm and maintained offices both in Medford within the “Opera House” block at 16-22 High Street (see MDF.1108) and in Boston at 19 Exchange Street in 1893 and later at 60 State Street in 1900. According to advertisements published in the local directories the firm specialized in subdivision and residential development: “surveys and divisions of Real Estate carefully attended to.”</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The division of the house into a two-family took place shortly after Hodges’ death. By 1924 it was occupied by two heads of household, George S. Harvey (b. 1898) and Vaughan S. Blanchard (b. 1890). George Harvey was a salesman of paper cartons, possibly with the Russell Box Company at 200 Boston Avenue (see MDF.AG). Blanchard was for several decades the Physical Director of Medford High School. Between at least 1930 and 1940 the house was tenanted by Nettie O. Merritt (b. 1869), the widow of Otis R. Merritt, and Sarah A. Hamilton (b. 1865). Nettie Merritt ran a boarding house that was occupied by several long-term tenants, including William Richards (b. 1876), a divorced local merchant who owned a plumbing supply shop on Salem Street, and Richard D. Shanahan (b. 1849), retired.</em></p>
