<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Joseph J. Maggiore Jr. House and its two neighbors to the east stand out in a neighborhood of smaller, 1920s and 1930s Colonial Revival and Tudor style houses. Employing an array of projecting gables and round-headed windows, the house is an early example of the suburban type designated ‘millennium mansion’ in McAlester’s new edition of A Field Guide to American Houses.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>The most prominent feature on the house is the garage, a hallmark of the building’s late 20<sup>th</sup> century construction date. Like most modern houses, the building sits on a poured concrete foundation, is covered in vinyl clapboard siding, and has an asphalt shingle roof. The one-and-a-half story side-gable house has clipped gable or ‘jerkinhead’ ends and several projections that give it some visual interest. The main entry is roughly centered on the house and is recessed a few feet into the main façade, creating an entry porch. The entry door is to the left with a set of paired casement windows to the right. To the right of the recessed entry is the garage, a two-story hipped-roof section that projects out in front of the main body of the house. The single-bay, two-car garage is set at the basement level, with windowless living space above. To the east of the entry is a shallow projecting cross gable. On the main façade of the cross gable is a pair of casement windows topped by a segmental arched window, signifying the possible location of a living room.</em></p>
<p><em>Covering the west two-thirds of the roof, over the main entry and garage, is a large hip-roofed dormer. Two wall gable windows on the main façade of the dormer suggest this hip-roofed space provides additional room for the building’s bedrooms. The gabled windows are paired casement windows, like the ones on the first floor. They are topped by segmental arched louvered vents that do not span the whole width of the windows.</em></p>
<p><em>The Maggiore House sits on a cul-de-sac at the end of Pilgrim Road, facing northeast. The house is slightly elevated above the street, with a sloping front yard. Because of the hill, the garage is built at a lower level than the main house, as noted above. Two runs of stairs lead from the driveway in front of the garage up to the main entry.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Joseph J. Maggiore Jr. House was built on a lot that was not subdivided until the 1980s, which was unusual for this densely-developed residential neighborhood. The land the house sits on was once part of 35 Hillside Avenue (MDF.26), which sits behind the Maggiore House to the south. Domenic Alto purchased the large 51,725 square foot lot of 35 Hillside Avenue from Josephine D. Bono and Mary Bono in 1968. No further information has been found on the Bonos, their relationship, or when and how they acquired the property. The same year, Alto sold a half-interest in the property to a group of men doing business as Zamparelli and White, while maintaining the other half-interest for himself.</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>The Zamparelli and White firm included John F. Zamparelli, David R. White, Anthony J. Diperna, and David Berman. Little information has been found about most of the men in the group, but John F. Zamparelli was a politically active and well-known Medford resident.</em> He served in the Navy during World War II and graduated from Tufts University and Boston College Law School. Zamparelli was elected Register of Deeds for Middlesex County in 1969, and held that position for many years. No information has been found connecting him to the other men in the Zamparelli and White group, nor has any information been found on his real estate interests. Zamparelli sold his interest in the land to David R. White in 1978, removing him from the ownership group. A later deed notes a court case for the dissolution of Zamparelli and White, but no other information has been found on the company. The occupations of the other men are unclear. The group filed a plan with the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds in 1983 dividing the large lot into two smaller lots. Lot A, to the south, had 22,397 square feet and the house at 35 Hillside Avenue. Lot B, to the north, was an empty lot of 29,512 square feet.</p>
<p>In 1984, the group sold their shares in the undeveloped Lot B to Frank J. and Charlotte A. Scuderi. Mrs. Scuderi is the daughter of the subdivision’s developer, Domenic Alto, who retained a share in the property’s ownership. The Scuderis are real estate agents in Medford with an office at 12 High Street. In 1985 the Scuderis filed a subdivision plan with the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds and the Medford Planning Board showing the creation of three lots and a cul-de-sac at the end of Pilgrim Road. It is unclear if the Scuderis built houses on the three lots before they sold the lots to new owners. The deeds between the Scuderis and the new owners do not mention buildings although the construction dates of the buildings are generally the same year the Scuderis sold the lots.</p>
<p>The Scuderis sold the lot of the Maggiore House to Joseph J. Maggiore, Jr. and his wife Theresa M. in 1989. The Maggiores are the current owners of the property.</p>
<p><em>Even though it was recently constructed, the Joseph J. Maggiore Jr. House is part of the Hillside Avenue Historic District because it was built on land included in the district. The district was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 21, 1975 and was made a local historic district on February 15, 1985. This property was included in the expansion of the Hillside LHD in 2002.</em></p>
