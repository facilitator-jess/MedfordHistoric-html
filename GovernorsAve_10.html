<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p>The headquarters of the Medford Historical Society at 10 Governors Avenue (MDF.119) was constructed in 1916. This almost unique building is one of the few examples of a dedicated historical society building known to exist. It is an unusual “T” shaped gabled structure in an incongruous yet charming interpretation of the Mission style finished in stucco in a light-blue/gray hue and clay-tiled parapets. The top of the “T” has a narrow, two-story gable front with a full-arched recessed side entry to the right and is capped by a gabled open belfry. The side wing is a single story resting on a half-exposed basement revealed by the downward slope of Governors Ave toward the south. The basement is delineated by a raised water table at the floor level. Although the windows have been replaced with newer vinyl-clad one-over-one sash, the building retains its original masonry sills, lintels and oak double-leaf front door.</p>
<p>Detailing on the otherwise unadorned stucco structure is limited to the water table, lintels, sills, molded cornice, and distinctive terra cotta tiles that protect the tops of the parapets. The building is sited at a moderate landscaped setback. It is located at the edge of the High Street corridor commercial area to the south. North of the building is an entirely residential area constructed during the late-19<sup>th</sup> through early 20<sup>th</sup> century for local elites. On the opposite side of Governors Avenue, a wide boulevard with a broad central greensward, to the north, is the Bradlee-Hall Estate area (MDF.L).</p>
<p>The interior of the building, open to the public, has three main spaces. The main entrance opens into a large vestibule. Within the base of the “T” is a larger assembly and display room that holds a large number of artifacts from Medford’s history. The second story of the tip of the “T” is a library room. Most of the original building fabric on the interior survives.</p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Medford Historical Society was founded in 1896 under the guidance of its first president, William Cushing Wait (1860 – Jan. 29, 1935). Wait, a native of Charlestown, was a prominent local jurist who resided at 194 Forest Street. He attended Harvard College (1882) and Harvard Law School (1885). After practicing law for several decades in the prominent Boston firm of Elder, Wait and Whitman, headed by Samuel J. Elder, he was appointed to the Massachusetts Superior Court in 1902 and served as a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court from 1923 to 1935. In addition to his activities with the Historical Society he served on the Medford School Committee for 25 years. He was also a member of the prestigious Union Club in Boston.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Another prominent early president of the organization, c. 1912, was local builder and real estate developer Lewis Hutchinson Lovering (1848 – Aug. 22, 1939). Lovering was also very active in local politics, serving in a number of Medford city positions, including as mayor for four years, from 1887-1890 (see MDF.1103).</em></p>
<p><em>The Society initially occupied space in what is known as the Francis House at 2 Ashland Street. This building was constructed in 1800 for Converse Francis and is known as the birthplace of his daughter, Lydia Maria Child (1802-1880), the prolific published author and abolitionist.</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>After purchasing this building in 1902, the Society shortly thereafter sold to a developer, who altered the building drastically to its present form. After renting space in another building on Governors Avenue that does not survive, the Society constructed its present headquarters in 1916. Among the Society’s activities throughout its history were the organization of local events and pageants related to the history of Medford, acting as a repository for an extensive collection of artifacts and paper records, and the publication of 43 volumes of the Medford Historical Register between January of 1898 and December of 1940.</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <em>Early in its history the Society sponsored weekly readings of papers on topics of local history by members that were regularly published in the Register. Among them was “The Early Physicians of Medford” read by Dr. Charles M. Green in April of 1897. As late as November of 1926 Mrs. Ruth Dame Coolidge read her paper entitled “The Craddock House, Past and Present.” Among the well-attended social events sponsored by the Society was a dance at the Opera House in 1900 and a review, “The Parada,” of music and tableaux vivant, held at the same venue. During the 1920s the Society helped organize annual reenactments of and parades commemorating the ride of Paul Revere. In 1931 the Society</em> hosted the Bay State Historical League at their headquarters, which approved a motion to “protest against placing on the Old State House [of Boston] of tablets that are poorly designed and executed and which will deface this historical relic of the State and Nation, which is held in trust by the City of Boston…Several speakers…took strong issue against any tablets worded or containing bas reliefs historically inaccurate…Three speakers intimated that Mayor Curley [well-known U.S. Congressman, Mayor and Governor of Massachusetts James Michael Curley] was interested in placing tablets on historic places as a matter of publicity for himself.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <em>The Society, which remains active, plays an important role in stewarding a historic site, the Peter Tufts House, which it acquired from SPNEA during the 1980s.</em></p>
<p><em>Moses Whitcher Mann, Architect and Builder</em></p>
<p><em>The Society headquarters building was designed and constructed by its president at the time, Moses W. Mann (</em>1846 – Mar. 10, 1933). Mann was a prolific local carpenter/builder whose advantageous marriage to Elizabeth Jenkins Clapp, a stepdaughter of Samuel Socrates Holton (<em>1817 – Jan. 11, 1894), greatly benefited his career.</em><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <em>S.S. Holton, with his son Samuel Slade (b. 1851) developed much of West Medford using Mann as their primary contractor (see West Medford Overview and Recommendations, Medford Historical Commission web site and Medford Hillside History of Development).</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moses W. Mann engaged in business with his father as a builder, for some two years after reaching his majority. At the time of his marriage was in charge of improvements in the western part of Medford, building the first house in the section then opening up, now almost entirely filled with residences, many of which were erected by him, a section now one of the most attractive of the city. He has been actively engaged in building, and has nearly all the year since been a resident of West Medford, doing much to promote its growth and prosperity.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>In addition to his role in the development of West Medford, Mann was very active in the Society, later serving as editor of its regular publication, the Medford Historical Register. During the early 20<sup>th</sup> century he authored numerous articles for the Register, including “The West End Schoolhouse,” Vol. 8, 1905; “A Pioneer Railroad and How it was Built,” Vol. 12, 1909; “The Mystic Works,” 1917; and “Medford Steamboat Days,” Vol. 17, 1914.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2002 the Hillside Avenue Local Historic District boundaries were expanded to include this building and the other lots fronting Governors Avenue northward to number 34.</em></p>
