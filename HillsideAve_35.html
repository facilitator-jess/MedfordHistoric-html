<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>Situated at the head of Hillside Avenue on a lot of high ground overlooking the Mystic River and the High Street commercial corridor, the John W.</em> Hastings H<em>ouse is a highly developed example of the Shingle Style and a prominent landmark in the neighborhood. The Shingle Style is thought to be a synthesis of the British Queen Anne and American Colonial Revival movements, with a strong emphasis on picturesque massing, horizontality, and prominent use of its namesake façade material. The style developed in the late 1870s is thought to have reached its full maturity in the early 1880s, placing this c. 1881-1882 house among the earlier examples of this style. Indeed, this date makes it contemporary with seminal regional and national examples of the style, including the Stoughton House at Cambridge and the Isaac Bell house at Newport, although this house shows more influence of the slightly more established Queen Anne style than either of those two examples. Nonetheless, its early date of construction and sophisticated massing and ornamental schemes suggests the work of an architect engaged in the latest architectural fashion. The identity of such an architect has not yet been determined. The house was the first in a group of high-style houses in the Queen Anne, Shingle, and Colonial Revival styles on Hillside and Grandview Avenues.</em></p>
<p><em>Rising from a foundation of pink granite in a random ashlar pattern, the asymmetry and picturesque massing of the façade belies the building’s nearly unbroken rectangular footprint. The roof is side gabled, with a shallow pitch on the western third of the house, and a steeper pitch on the remaining section. These roofs slope down to form a saltbox shape on the side and rear elevations. The roofs on the side and rear elevations contain a number of apparently later dormer additions. On the front two broad gables, grouped in the eastern third of the building, break the roofline. This compound roof form, here in an M pattern, is common to the Queen Anne style. The gables are lit by 8/8 windows on the left hand side, and a large flatted arch on the right. Two large brick chimneys with articulated pots break the roofline. A small addition, one and one-half stories high with a roofline lower than the main body of the house, extends from the eastern elevation. This was added after 1976, most likely as a result of the building’s 1986 condominium conversion.</em></p>
<p><em>The fenestration is deliberately random and assertively asymmetrical, featuring a remarkable variety of window sizes, shapes, and ornamentation. Such variety adds to the picturesque effect of the style, suggesting an evolution over time. On the first floor, a shallow bay window with a grouping of eight leaded-glass casement windows is placed to the left of the primary entrance. On the right are three irregularly placed 16/12 windows, flanked by raised panels. The primary entrance to the house is recessed in an alcove behind a broad wooden arch. The flanks of this alcove are rounded and lit with multi-pane windows, also rounded. An open deck with a low balustrade runs across the front of the building. Formerly surrounded by an open railing, these balustrades are now covered in shingles. The two oriel windows and three 16/12 windows which light the second floor have no relation to the openings below them. These two oriel windows are both finished differently. The left-hand oriel is generously fenestrated, with multiple panes of colored-glass windows. Its corners are rounded, with rounded glass windows. The right oriel is semi-octagonal. It also contains arrays of colored glass, though, smaller, and surrounded by panels. This oriel also has a robust corbel base.</em></p>
<p><em>Among the hallmarks of the Queen Anne and Shingle styles is an attention to contrasting wall surfaces, as well as richly expressive ornament. As with many examples of this style, ornamental themes are drawn from the British Queen Anne movement, which was then experiencing a revival on both sides of the Atlantic. The forms at the Hastings/Warner house are particularly expressive. A variety of wood shingles covers the house’s façade. Now painted grey, with white trim, early photographs show the house with a dark color scheme, more typical of the style. On the first floor shingles are laid in a regular pattern, with a wide exposure. On the second floor, above a broad belt course, shingles are laid with a more narrow exposure and irregular staggering. A series of wavy shingles covers the top of the wall on the second floor. The two broad gables are covered by a combination of staggered, wave, and fish-scale shingles. Half-timbering and other ornamental patterns also cover the right gable. The spandrel of the board arch surrounding the entrance is elaborated by heavily carved flowing tendrils and other foliate patterns. An asymmetrical acanthus leaf is centered in place of a keystone. On the second floor above this entrance, a large craved plaque represents a sheaf of wheat. While frequently such ornamentation is an allusion to the occupation or income source of a the occupants of a house, that does not appear to be true in this case, as the Hastings family for whom the house was built made their money in cotton, hardware, and real estate. Additional tendril patterns appear in the right gable.</em></p>
<p><em>The east and west elevations of the house, as well as its foundation are obscured by heavy foliage. The east elevation is largely covered by a later addition. The west has an octagonal bay window and secondary entrance, covered by a small porch, on the first floor. Archival maps and photographs depict a shingle-covered and turreted stable or other ancillary building to the northwest of the house. That structure has since been demolished. The building’s main elevation is otherwise in an excellent state of preservation.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>As the first house constructed in the subdivision and district, the John W. Hastings house set a trend for the subsequent development of the rest of the subdivision with large-scale, elaborate, generally single-family houses professionally designed for affluent Boston commuters. Though many of the exact details remain unclear, throughout its early history 35 Hillside was associated with prominent Medford families, most of whom had close economic and professional ties to Boston. At three or more points in its history, including at its initial construction, the house appears to have been occupied by two separate, though related, households. This suggests the possibility that it was initially constructed as a duplex, though there is no evidence of this configuration from the street. However it is supported by the building’s current use as a two-unit condominium property. Large duplexes of this type, massed and ornamented as single family houses were quite common in the inner suburbs of Boston. They have been well documented, for example, by Warner, in the Roxbury section of Boston.</em></p>
<p><em>According to title research done on this property by the Massachusetts Historical Commission in the 1970s, this house was built between July 1881, when the land on which it stands was sold by Thatcher Magoun, Jr. and Martha B. Adams to John W. Hastings (1819-1883), and May 1882, when Hastings mortgaged the property and the house on it. Hastings was the son of the prominent Edmund T. Hastings (1789 – 1861), who lived in an Asher Benjamin-designed house in West Medford. The Hastings family is associated with the development of that part of Medford, and is the family for whom Hastings Park is named. In 1880, immediately prior to the construction of the house on Hillside Ave, Hastings lived on Mystic Street in West Medford with his wife Sarah, his son Edmund T. (1851-1886), an 1876 Harvard College graduate named for his grandfather and uncle, as well as two servants. The Hastings’ estate was worth at least $100,000 at this date.</em></p>
<p><em>The two generations of Hastings would continue to live together after the construction of the Hillside Avenue house. The likely date of its construction generally coincides with the marriage of Edmund to Harriet Bolles of Boston in 1882. The couple lived with Edmund’s parents in the house for the entirety of their brief marriage. Edmund was a Boston-based merchant, first in cotton, and later in heavy hardware. He was a senior partner in the firm of Bradlee, Hastings and Company. However, the Hastings family’s time in the house was short, and marked by untimely death. The older Hastings died of cancer in 1883, shortly after the house was finished. His wife Sarah as well Edmund and his wife continued to live in the house until at least 1886. Edmund died of typhoid fever on May 8, 1886 at age 34. His mother Sarah died a year later. It is not know how long the widowed Harriet remained in the house after this point.</em></p>
<p><em>It is unclear what happened at the house between the time of Sarah’s death and its 1890 sale Baxter E. and Charlotte Perry. Baxter Perry (1826-1906) was a prominent Boston-based lawyer in the firm of Perry and Perry, which had offices at 1 Beacon Street in that city. Perry married Charlotte Hough in 1851. He was the second mayor of Medford during his residence in this house (1895-97) and later served as a term as a republican in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Perry was a graduate of Middlebury College, had four children, including George H., with whom he was in law practice. In this practice Perry served as the attorney for Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy, with whom he was also involved in a number of real estate transactions to secure the site for the Mother Church. He was disbarred in 1897 after being accused of improper financial dealings while acting as executor of two separate estates. Perry, a Mason, was prominent in many Medford civic institutions, including serving as president of the Young Men’s Christian Association at the time of its founding in 1866. Perry died in 1906 at his summer house in Maine.</em></p>
<p><em>The ownership of the building around the turn of the century is unclear. On the 1898 atlas the building is listed as the property of Bella H. Warner (1830 – 1912). Warner was president of the East Salt Company, a large industrial operation in Boston with offices on State Street. Warner, with whose name the house as commonly been associated, seems to have split his time between Boston and Medford. The 1900 census for the property lists Bella H. Warner as living on Hillside Ave, with a note reading "house vacant – closed." Warner is also listed in the Boston census that year as a resident of the Hotel Brunswick in Copley Square. However, Warner appears in the 1905 and 1907 Medford directory as living at 35 Hillside. Warner died in his room at the Hotel Brunswick in 1912. His estate was valued at that time at $378,072, though no mention is made of property in Medford in the published reports of the reading of Warner’s will. Instead, he stipulated that a large sum of money be donated to the town of Topsfield to buy library books. Despite Warner’s apparent connection with the house, the earlier MHC title search does not locate a transfer to Warner. Additionally, on both the 1900 and 1906 atlases the house was still listed as the property of Charlotte Perry, though the Perrys did not seem to be in Medford for the census manuscripts these years. The Perrys were also not found in the Medford directories of this period, though Baxter Perry’s death was recorded in the 1907 directory. The building’s association with multiple households continued into the twentieth century. In the 1924 directory Paul and Salvatore Andolino, who are listed separately, occupied the building. In the middle part of the Twentieth century the land on which the house stood was reduced by the subdivision of land to the north and east of the house. Small single family houses, including a number of Pilgrim Road, stand on land once associated with this house. The lot’s sized was reduced from over 55,000 square feet to its present 22,000. This subdivision process resulted in the demolition of the large Shingle Style stable that once stood on the property. By 1986 the building was converted into two four-bedroom condominium units.</em></p>
