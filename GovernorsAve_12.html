<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Mary B. Held House is typical of suburban construction from the early part of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Although the building’s form is very traditional, its size and materials distinguish it as new construction. It is a two-and-a-half story double-pile gable-block house, five bays wide with a center entry, which in modern parlance would be described as ‘colonial.’ The house sits on a poured concrete foundation, is covered in painted wood clapboards, and has an asphalt shingle roof. It is sited on a steep hillside location, allowing for a single-bay, two-car garage sheltered by a shallow, hipped, pent roof in the basement of the south half of its facade. The main entry is accessed by a long two-run set of stairs that lead to an open entrance porch covered by a flat roof. The entrance porch is supported by heavy brick pillars and is decorated by balustrades at both the entry and roof level, creating a balcony in the second story. At the rear of the house, aerial photographs show that only a single story is above grade because of the hillside location. An open porch runs across the second story of the north (left) elevation. The windows on the house are one-over-one sash framed by applied shutters mounted outside the plain architraves, and three gabled dormers are evenly-spaced across the forward slope of the roof.</em></p>
<p><em>The Held House faces east onto Governors Avenue. As noted earlier, the lot is on the side of a hill, with the land rising steeply to the north and west of the house. The small area in front of the house is heavily landscaped, as is the hill to the north and west of the house.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The Mary B. Held House is a recent addition to the neighborhood, built on land that until recently belonged to the city of Medford. It is self-evident that the reason the land remained undeveloped for so long was its difficult topography. Atlas and map evidence regarding the history of this land is not definitive. According to one source, it was owned by the Town of Medford as early as 1875 and had been acquired from the estate of Dr. Daniel Swan (1781-1864).</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>It may have been acquired to accommodate the High School, which stood at the current site of the CVS Pharmacy at 85 High Street as early as 1855. A small lot between the High School and the rest of the city-owned land on the corner of High Street and Governors Avenue belonged to “J. Perry” as late as 1897. Sanborn Atlases, however, depict the land owned by Nicholas White until sometime between 1903 and 1910. By 1910 the land had become the site of the city’s telephone exchange building, which was located at the northeast corner of High Street and Governors Avenue.</em></p>
<p><em>In the 1950s the city-owned land to the north of the Historical Society building was split into two parcels, a smaller parcel of 5,300 square feet surrounded by a larger parcel of 13,605 square feet (see plan, below). The reason for this odd division is unclear, but the smaller parcel was sold by the city first, in 1957. By the 1970s Mary B. Held and her husband Richard C. Held had inherited the smaller lot, and in 1977 they sold it to their son Ronald J. Held. In 1981 Mrs. Held acquired the larger 13,605 square foot parcel from the city of Medford, and that same year her son sold her the smaller parcel, leaving her in sole control of the two pieces of formerly city-owned land. Mrs. Held appears to have done nothing with the land, and in 2002 sold both parcels to TR Recovery Corporation. TR Recovery was registered in 1994 with an address in Middleton, although Anthony Centrella, the listed president, treasurer, and secretary, gives a Medford address; the company was involuntarily dissolved in 2012. No further information is available about the company.</em></p>
<p><em>TR Recovery filed a plan with the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds in 2004 showing new lot lines for the land they purchased from Mrs. Held. This plan divided the land into two lots, one of about 10,000 square feet and the second a little less than 8,000 square feet. TR Recovery appears to have built houses on both lots, a house at 25 Grandview Avenue in 2003 and the Held House in 2005. After the houses were built, TR Recovery sold the properties to their current owners.</em></p>
<p><em>Even though it was recently constructed, the Mary B. Held House is part of the Hillside Avenue Historic District because it was built on land included in the district. The district was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 21, 1975 and was made a local historic district on February 15, 1985.</em></p>
