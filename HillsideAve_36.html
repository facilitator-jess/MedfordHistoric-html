<p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe architectural features. Evaluate the characteristics of this building in terms of other buildings within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>The John J. McCarron House is a simple post-war Colonial Revival single-family house identical to its neighbors to the south at 30 and 32 Hillside Avenue. The two-story, side-gable, double-pile house sits on a poured concrete foundation, is covered in painted wood shingles, and has an asphalt shingle roof. Attached to the south, left elevation at the basement level accommodated by the steep downward slope of Hillside Avenue is a single-bay, single-car garage, also with a side-gable roof. While aerial photographs show a small enclosed porch on the rear of the other two houses, the porch on the McCarron House has been enclosed and extended up to two stories under a shed roof. This addition is just visible on the south elevation.</em></p>
<p><em>The McCarron House, in contrast to the older Colonial Revival and Queen Anne style houses in the rest of the neighborhood is notably simple simpler and smaller in scale. Its form is a smaller side-entry variant of the more popular symmetrical center-entrance Colonial Revival prevalent throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The main entry is located at the north end of the main façade, and is sheltered by an open porch with a hipped roof supported by carved brackets that appear to be salvaged from an Italianate house. As at the house next door at 32 Hillside Avenue, this open porch is a recent addition. Although it is visible in the assessor’s photograph, it is not shown in street view images from 2007. Instead, a simple projecting pediment similar to the one found on 30 Hillside Avenue is over the door, suggesting this was the original treatment of the doorways on the three houses. Unlike the other two houses, the McCarron House retains its original six-over-six sash windows, which are protected by storm windows. Shutters frame the windows on the main façade; there are no shutters on the sides of the house. The first floor is highlighted by a group of three windows to the south of the main entry. The façade’s fenestration and entrance pattern suggests a side hall plan with living and dining room spaces on the left and a kitchen behind the main stair on the right. On the front pile of the north elevation is a secondary entrance. Its placement at grade, partially in the building’s foundation, suggests it leads down to the building’s basement.</em></p>
<p><em>The McCarron House sits on the west side of Hillside Avenue facing southeast across the street. The steep slope of Pasture Hill rises across the lot, with the garage on the south end of the house sitting slightly below the main level of the house. The lot is open, with no major plantings or mature trees.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p><em>Discuss the history of the building. Explain its associations with local (or state) history. Include uses of the building, and the role(s) the owners/occupants played within the community.</em></p>
<p><em>Although the John J. McCarron House is part of the Hillside Avenue Historic District, it was built much later than the neighboring houses. The McCarron House, as well as the two houses to the south at 30 and 32 Hillside Avenue, were part of a parcel of land that was not developed until 1947. Charles H. Webster owned the land in 1898, and lived nearby for a time at 15 Hillside Avenue (MDF.276). It is unclear how he acquired it from the Magoun estate, which owned much of the land in the area during the 19<sup>th</sup> century. At some point in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Angelina Gange acquired the land; it was divided into two parcels, one 9,141 square feet and the second 9,818 square feet. Gange was an Italian immigrant who arrived in the United States with her husband Adolfo in 1895. While census and directory records from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century list Adolfo as a sole sorter for a leather company, by 1938 he had established a real estate and insurance business with an office on Main Street, near Medford Square. A. Gange &amp; Sons, Inc. is still based in Medford, and is operated by Adolfo and Angelina’s grandson.</em></p>
<p><em>After Angelina Gange’s death, Adolfo Gange sold the land on Hillside Avenue to local builder Gerard P. Friel in 1947, with some legal maneuvering. The deed includes the phrase “with the buildings thereon,” but it seems likely that Friel built the three houses himself, possibly during the time when the deed was signed and when it was recorded. The deed between Gange and Friel was signed October 24, 1947, but was not recorded until December 18, 1947. In addition, the Gange-Friel deed was for two parcels (totaling the amount of land the three parcels occupy) for $3,400. Friel recoded a plan on December 18, 1947, showing three lots with three buildings (see below for plan). Friel also took out mortgages on the three properties on December 18, for $7,500 each. The change in the number of lots and the change in value between October and December suggest that Friel was building the houses at that time. Friel is listed in census records and directories from the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century as a builder living on High Street. He then sold each lot in 1948, the year after he acquired them.</em></p>
<p><em>In 1948 Friel sold the McCarron house to Henry L. and Yvonne V. Burke. Almost ten years later, in 1957, the Burkes sold their property to John J. and June A. McCarron, who lived in the house for over 50 years. After Mrs. McCarron’s death in 2010, her estate sold the property in 2011.</em></p>
<p><em>The John J. McCarron House is part of the Hillside Avenue Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 21, 1975 and which was made a local historic district on February 15, 1985.</em></p>
